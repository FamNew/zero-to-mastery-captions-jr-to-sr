Hey there it's Bruno again.

00:03.700 --> 00:04.570
How's your weekend.

00:04.570 --> 00:05.370
Hope you had a good day.

00:05.360 --> 00:07.290
Mine was fantastic.

00:07.390 --> 00:12.160
Hey listen we think of server side rendering.

00:12.210 --> 00:17.220
Shall we turn our robo friends up into a server rendered app.

00:17.230 --> 00:23.350
I'm starting to trust her judgment on things and I would love to have you make a decision for us on

00:23.350 --> 00:24.160
this one.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.670
Thanks appreciated.

00:25.720 --> 00:27.600
P.S. love your outfit today.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.190
All right.

00:30.450 --> 00:32.920
It's time for a nother task at hand.

00:33.210 --> 00:40.260
In this section we're going to talk about server side rendering versus client side rendering the two

00:40.260 --> 00:44.450
ways that we can display our apps to a user.

00:44.540 --> 00:50.570
It's a super interesting topic and something that all projects should consider if they want to be a

00:50.570 --> 00:52.050
modern technology firm.

00:52.190 --> 00:55.490
So let's get into it and I'll see you in the next video.
