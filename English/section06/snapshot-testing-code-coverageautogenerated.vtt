00:01.550 --> 00:02.770
Welcome back.

00:02.770 --> 00:10.360
Let's use snapshot testing to test some of these other simple presentational components that are completely

00:10.360 --> 00:11.290
stateless.

00:11.480 --> 00:13.190
So we saw how easy that is.

00:13.450 --> 00:16.020
So let me make this a little bit smaller.

00:17.220 --> 00:21.420
And make sure we were on NPM test to have it running in the background.

00:25.770 --> 00:31.960
We see that our test or our car component is being tested now.

00:32.070 --> 00:34.340
So let's create another one.

00:35.570 --> 00:39.520
Let's create a test for the Carlist component.

00:39.660 --> 00:45.230
I'm going to remove the console log here because we don't need it and let's create a car list.

00:45.320 --> 00:52.180
Test file card list that test dodginess

00:55.880 --> 00:59.720
And again it's failing because we need to make sure we have at least a single test.

01:00.770 --> 01:09.650
We can actually go back to card that test us and just copy and paste this go to Carlists component copy

01:09.650 --> 01:16.510
and paste whatever we had and just change our component to cardless.

01:16.540 --> 01:18.200
So let's just do that quickly.

01:19.020 --> 01:28.870
You can just select all of the sensei card list let me save and we have some Filcher.

01:28.990 --> 01:37.880
Let's see why we see that we get a type error cannot every property map of undefined and that is because

01:38.240 --> 01:45.170
card list you see Card component is just rendering name and email but it's not doing anything to it.

01:45.170 --> 01:51.740
So if it doesn't get name in email I'll just render undefined when we go to card list we see that we're

01:51.740 --> 01:56.170
actually receiving the robots and we need to map over them.

01:56.510 --> 02:01.190
But in our test we're rendering card or Musco to Carlist.

02:01.190 --> 02:04.280
I'm going to close this so you don't get confused.

02:04.370 --> 02:06.390
We're not passing down robots.

02:06.590 --> 02:16.050
So in this test when we try and render Carlist it's going to fail because there's no robots to map over.

02:16.230 --> 02:18.860
So let's fix that.

02:18.930 --> 02:30.310
All we need to do here is just mock our robots so we can just say Konst robots or Leger's say mock robots

02:30.910 --> 02:35.590
is going to equal an array of some dummy data that we can create.

02:35.590 --> 02:47.740
So let's say that this is going to have an ID of one and we'll have the name of John Snow.

02:50.510 --> 02:57.120
Let's say username is going to be John John.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.500
And let's say that e-mail.

02:59.600 --> 03:03.270
I don't think we're using your user name but I wanted to give that user name anyway.

03:03.620 --> 03:08.520
It's going to be on at gmail dot com.

03:08.530 --> 03:11.500
Now we can just pass our mock robots

03:15.060 --> 03:17.480
as the robots.

03:20.760 --> 03:21.940
So let's see if that works.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.080
I'm going to save.

03:24.140 --> 03:24.880
All right.

03:24.950 --> 03:33.300
And we have our tests passing and if we go to our snapshot we see that we have a card list snapshot

03:33.360 --> 03:33.940
as well.

03:35.110 --> 03:35.590
That's good.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.220
Our tests failed because we werent passing robots.

03:38.230 --> 03:44.860
And while we want to make sure that we actually pass those properties and you can imagine you can probably

03:44.860 --> 03:52.900
do the same thing with card as well or maybe have a default in this component where if you don't receive

03:52.900 --> 04:00.520
name email and I.D. that it has some sort of an error boundary or an output that it does for the user.

04:02.460 --> 04:12.150
We now see the power of snapshot testing we see how we can mock some of our properties and you might

04:12.450 --> 04:19.320
want to just go ahead and do snapshot testing for some of these other cases that are quite simple to

04:19.320 --> 04:21.920
do to increase our test coverage.

04:22.020 --> 04:24.190
And I'm going to leave that up to you because.

04:24.300 --> 04:27.400
Well just to give you a bit of extra practice.

04:27.600 --> 04:32.890
So let's move on to the next video where we do some things that are a little bit more difficult.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.650
But just to check.

04:34.650 --> 04:38.790
Let's do our coverage to make sure that our coverage for the Carlist is now looking good.

04:40.350 --> 04:44.020
All right do make this a little bit bigger and we see that.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.550
Yep look at that.

04:45.550 --> 04:47.770
Feels good getting 100 percent doesn't it.

04:47.770 --> 04:50.190
Carlists component is now well tested as well.

04:51.270 --> 04:52.970
I'll see in the next one by.
