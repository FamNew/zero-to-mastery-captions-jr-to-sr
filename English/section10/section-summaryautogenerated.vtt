Hey there monster man.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.040
Love this new feature you add it for us.

00:05.090 --> 00:07.880
It makes our smart brain up so much better.

00:07.940 --> 00:09.350
Anyway people are loving it.

00:09.350 --> 00:11.570
Really appreciate your help as always.

00:11.600 --> 00:15.040
Good job.

00:15.190 --> 00:23.010
In this short extra bits section we learned about how to join a project how to start reading the code

00:23.020 --> 00:30.740
setting up the project on your computer but also strategically figuring out the best way to get a customer

00:30.760 --> 00:32.960
a used to the codebase.

00:33.070 --> 00:36.390
Because most of the times we're not going to start from scratch.

00:36.400 --> 00:41.520
We're not going to be the ones building the apps and know everything inside and out.

00:41.620 --> 00:48.610
Most of the time we enter big large projects and we have to get at them running really fast and be comfortable

00:48.610 --> 00:50.940
to start writing our own features.

00:51.850 --> 00:59.650
And by being smart and understanding how things are connected once you have that higher level view then

00:59.650 --> 01:02.810
you can start diving into the code individually.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.890
So again start from the top.

01:07.020 --> 01:09.680
Understand the big picture how things are connected.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.950
Make sure everything works on your machine.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.110
Then you start looking at the code one by one.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.320
And in this section we also did something fun.

01:18.360 --> 01:25.200
We managed to have our smart brain app detect multiple faces like this Spanish national soccer team

01:25.200 --> 01:32.700
here let's just test it out one last time I have a picture of the France

01:35.960 --> 01:39.800
and it even detects faces of Fretz.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.150
So I'll see in the next one.
