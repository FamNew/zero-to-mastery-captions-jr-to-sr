Hey it's Bruno here.

00:03.770 --> 00:04.340
Wow.

00:04.470 --> 00:07.630
This docker compose is amazing.

00:07.630 --> 00:08.730
Everybody's loving it.

00:08.730 --> 00:15.680
Everybody's just so happy that they don't have to set up databases and API servers and all that stuff.

00:15.710 --> 00:18.360
Those are just slowing us down anyway.

00:18.450 --> 00:20.030
Really fantastic work.

00:20.040 --> 00:25.530
I think we're going to be using this a lot and I hope to share this with other teams in our company

00:25.530 --> 00:31.200
as well because well it's just so good anyway appreciate it.

00:31.230 --> 00:32.800
I think he needs some rest though.

00:32.820 --> 00:35.440
Go home take a break and I'll see you tomorrow.

00:38.520 --> 00:44.920
That was a nother full section that really taught us about docker and containers.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.050
And let's pause for a second.

00:47.050 --> 00:50.560
You may be asking yourself why do we need this again.

00:50.770 --> 00:53.290
It looks like we're creating more headaches for us.

00:53.430 --> 01:00.520
But you see there's a big problem beyond just the hassle of setting up postscripts and node and all

01:00.520 --> 01:03.280
these other tools to get our environment set up.

01:03.400 --> 01:10.300
We need to make sure that the same version of node postscripts read s and other services are installed

01:10.630 --> 01:13.750
in the right way correctly on each computer.

01:13.750 --> 01:20.330
Each one of the developers we need to make sure our laptops and computers are working in the same fashion.

01:20.890 --> 01:23.720
And this is a big problem for companies.

01:23.740 --> 01:30.730
This gets even more important when you actually deploy your product when you deploy to all sorts of

01:30.730 --> 01:31.300
servers.

01:31.330 --> 01:34.380
You want to make sure that it works no matter where it's run.

01:34.750 --> 01:40.150
Containers allow us to make sure that we can run this piece of software anywhere.

01:40.300 --> 01:45.800
We take the responsibility of setting up the environment from everybody who needs the code.

01:45.910 --> 01:52.900
And as long as we set it up properly then we can just share that code with anybody and everybody should

01:52.900 --> 01:54.790
have it working properly.

01:55.300 --> 01:55.850
OK.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.440
So what have we learned.

01:58.280 --> 02:02.290
Well we've learned about docker what it is and how it works.

02:03.420 --> 02:11.890
We created a doc file and learn how to work with it using docker build doctrine dog her exec commands.

02:11.970 --> 02:20.810
We also used docker compose to orchestrate applications the different services that we have during development

02:22.690 --> 02:30.400
and now we were able to run our distributed application that can be run anywhere from just one single

02:30.400 --> 02:32.070
command.

02:32.290 --> 02:40.250
We used commands like Dr. compose build and dock or compose up to orchestrate our application services.

02:40.450 --> 02:44.070
We were able to link them with things such as links.

02:44.320 --> 02:52.460
We're able to do port forwarding and we were also able to pass on environmental variables and connect

02:52.790 --> 02:54.860
these two pieces together.

02:55.960 --> 03:03.490
Finally we did some fun things with SU up so that when we actually run the command we're able to in

03:03.490 --> 03:10.690
our dock or file or run our deploy schema so that everything runs smoothly and as soon as we run that

03:10.690 --> 03:17.700
command new tables are created for us to use without Dharker our developers would have had to install

03:17.700 --> 03:21.240
and configure each service kind of like we did in the previous section.

03:22.340 --> 03:30.070
You see now we have this beautiful environment for us to work at anybody joining our team is going to

03:30.070 --> 03:36.210
just take a little bit of time to install docker and have everything set up within half a day.

03:36.220 --> 03:39.330
This makes bosses very very happy.

03:40.040 --> 03:47.380
But we also learned that with docker we can really improve our production builds as well.

03:47.480 --> 03:55.580
We can just add containers to anything that we want wrap single services in containers and because they

03:55.580 --> 04:01.070
can run pretty much anywhere we can just keep duplicating them keep duplicating them and we have this

04:01.400 --> 04:08.960
architecture where we have small tiny services running in different locations all connected with each

04:08.960 --> 04:16.090
other but not having to worry about managing everything together in one location.

04:16.090 --> 04:16.880
All right.

04:17.170 --> 04:19.230
I think we need a break after that one.

04:19.240 --> 04:22.420
I hope you have fun talker is really really exciting.

04:22.600 --> 04:26.020
And we're going to be using it for the next part of the course.

04:27.190 --> 04:30.380
I hope you had fun and I'll see you in the next section.

04:30.540 --> 04:30.790
BABAE.
