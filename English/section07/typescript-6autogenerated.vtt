00:01.320 --> 00:03.650
All right let's keep going with new types.

00:03.660 --> 00:12.450
Another one I want to show you is a very useful one called interface and interface can be used really

00:12.450 --> 00:14.240
really well with objects.

00:14.370 --> 00:15.120
Let's have a look.

00:16.310 --> 00:28.010
I can say interface robot army and this robot army and you see the capitol letter here is just a standard

00:28.010 --> 00:37.010
with an interface that we have capital start to our names and let's just say that the count is number

00:38.600 --> 00:46.100
the type is string and let's say magic is string.

00:46.430 --> 00:58.960
So robot army has three properties so that now if I'm using this this robot army let's say I have a

00:59.050 --> 01:13.560
left fight robot army function and this function has let's say robots parameter that are receives.

01:13.730 --> 01:19.400
That takes robots that have of type robot army.

01:19.430 --> 01:21.350
So interface robot army

01:27.050 --> 01:36.110
and here will just say canceled or log.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.280
Now what did I just do here.

01:38.280 --> 01:45.420
This makes sure that this robot's parameter that I'm receiving is going to have a count a type and a

01:45.420 --> 01:46.870
magic property.

01:46.890 --> 01:52.260
Otherwise it's kind of throw an error and you might be thinking to yourself This might be useful for

01:52.260 --> 01:55.120
react and props and you'd be right.

01:55.200 --> 01:58.320
As you will see later on.

01:58.460 --> 02:02.230
So that above is the exact same thing as saying.

02:02.390 --> 02:06.360
Let me just copy this.

02:06.380 --> 02:13.870
That's the exact same as saying that we want the robots to have a count

02:16.540 --> 02:20.290
of all count of number

02:24.950 --> 02:35.000
a type of string and a magic value of also type string.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.480
So let's make that a little bit smaller.

02:40.500 --> 02:47.940
That's what we're doing up here except with an interface it allows you to have objects like this that

02:48.630 --> 02:54.920
create a new interface that allows us to make sure that certain objects have certain properties so if

02:54.920 --> 02:55.700
I safe here

02:59.480 --> 03:01.940
see I get a bit of an error let's see what it's here.

03:01.940 --> 03:09.230
Completion completion Oh and I have an error here because I'm using the same variable slots two here

03:10.190 --> 03:11.380
and there you go.

03:11.390 --> 03:12.590
Everything is working.

03:12.890 --> 03:16.060
So interfaces are extremely extremely useful.

03:16.070 --> 03:18.740
It's kind of like we're creating a new type here right.

03:18.740 --> 03:23.970
I mean Tiger doesn't have a robot army type but we're creating it.

03:23.990 --> 03:31.610
We're creating an interface that says hey from now on this robot army can act as a type that has these

03:31.610 --> 03:37.070
parameters that we've set for it which is very very cool very flexible and that's why interfaces are

03:37.070 --> 03:38.860
used a lot.

03:39.200 --> 03:45.500
Now in re-act applications you're going to see interfaces a lot and you might also see this other way

03:46.490 --> 03:51.830
of using this type keyword which also works.

03:51.830 --> 03:59.210
If I save your if I save this and I have to give it an equal over here.

04:00.260 --> 04:02.240
Everything still works.

04:02.270 --> 04:08.030
Now there is one difference between interfaces and type and I know the name gets confusing between the

04:08.030 --> 04:09.050
property that I just said.

04:09.050 --> 04:10.900
But don't worry they're different.

04:10.910 --> 04:17.300
The one difference is that interfaces create a new name that we can use everywhere such as the robots

04:17.300 --> 04:20.830
army type aliases as we'd like to call it.

04:20.990 --> 04:22.210
Don't create a new name

04:27.700 --> 04:31.320
and it has a few other features that you can read about.

04:31.330 --> 04:38.650
I always recommend using interfaces because it's a cleaner syntax and a better error output.

04:38.660 --> 04:39.080
All right.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.790
That's it for interfaces.

04:40.790 --> 04:46.800
Let's save and make sure that our errors are completely gone and I'll see you in the next video.

04:46.920 --> 04:47.170
But by.
