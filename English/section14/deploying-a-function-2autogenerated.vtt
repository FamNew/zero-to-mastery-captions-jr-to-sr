00:00.900 --> 00:07.920
Welcome back I think it's time for us to write a proper Brank function that we can use with our smart

00:07.920 --> 00:15.980
brain API so that in here perhaps we can have a little emoji icon that will show up based on the count.

00:16.270 --> 00:22.210
And we're using right now Lamda for a simple exercise but I hope your imagination is running wild right

00:22.210 --> 00:25.220
now with all the things you can do with LAMDA.

00:25.270 --> 00:31.330
It is so cool and so interesting I definitely want to see some creative implementations that people

00:31.330 --> 00:34.610
have with the smartphone app or with your own app.

00:34.690 --> 00:39.070
I would love to see and hear what you've done with lambda functions.

00:39.070 --> 00:45.220
Definitely posted in our community chat because I love all these things and how creative people can

00:45.220 --> 00:45.850
get with it.

00:46.880 --> 00:56.420
Now and here I'm going to do something fun and this function I'm going to have a little emoji set that

00:56.480 --> 01:03.220
I've created and these emojis are going to be our ranking system.

01:03.270 --> 01:07.920
This is where you start off with the keep growing you keep growing you keep growing until you get to

01:07.920 --> 01:12.620
the rocket ship the best rank of all.

01:12.620 --> 01:13.280
Now what should we do.

01:13.280 --> 01:19.980
Well first off let's put this outside of the function actually now I'll leave it like that just to show

01:19.980 --> 01:28.610
you that we can have things outside the function and inside of fear before we send out the response.

01:28.750 --> 01:40.530
I'm going to have a concert rank and this rank is going to equal event dot Querrey string parameters

01:40.990 --> 01:44.370
and you're asking ward where did you just get that from.

01:44.500 --> 01:49.770
Well if we go back to our event Ahar we don't have it anymore.

01:49.770 --> 01:53.360
Let's grab the and point from here.

01:55.020 --> 01:59.270
And paste it in here and add one to three.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.900
And here in the parameters

02:04.880 --> 02:09.390
what we wanted to do make sure we don't have the get request in here.

02:09.510 --> 02:12.020
Let's try that again and end here.

02:12.020 --> 02:19.770
If I go to query string parameters we see that we're able to have the query strings of our API endpoint.

02:20.310 --> 02:26.430
So we're going to send the entries count through this parameter and we're going to accessit on the lambda

02:26.430 --> 02:28.310
function.

02:28.410 --> 02:36.010
So I'm going to say from here from the query strings parameter I'm going to grab the rank and I'll show

02:36.010 --> 02:37.360
you how we do that.

02:37.570 --> 02:48.180
Surely now from here let's create a now there function that's going to be called Brank emoji and this

02:48.270 --> 02:52.130
random Moji is going to do a simple little function for us.

02:53.110 --> 02:57.060
We'll just say emoji use our little logic for us.

02:57.400 --> 03:05.700
If the rank is greater than the emojis dot lenth.

03:05.910 --> 03:12.330
So that is whatever the rank or the entries count of the user is if it's larger than our lenth which

03:12.330 --> 03:17.660
looks like we have about 9 if it's bigger than that.

03:17.680 --> 03:21.360
Well just returned the latest or the rocket ship.

03:22.290 --> 03:28.020
So if that's the case I'm going to say and yes we're doing a little funny syntax here.

03:28.050 --> 03:30.240
Remember Mojo's is just an array.

03:30.240 --> 03:36.450
And we're doing a little bit of logic inside of the array can get confusing but it's nice shorthand

03:36.450 --> 03:36.910
for now.

03:36.920 --> 03:38.460
I hope you can follow along.

03:39.270 --> 03:47.200
Let's say that for that case we're going to say that emoji is not lenth minus one that is.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.450
Get the latest badge.

03:50.550 --> 03:55.090
Otherwise just give whatever rank we have.

03:55.290 --> 03:57.600
If you have zero entries you'll get this one.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.710
Have one entries you'll get this one.

03:59.730 --> 04:00.620
Two entries.

04:00.630 --> 04:01.730
Three four.

04:01.740 --> 04:02.780
So on and so forth.

04:03.750 --> 04:07.080
So let's save.

04:07.150 --> 04:14.320
And then finally in our response object we're going to instead of the inputs being the event we're just

04:14.320 --> 04:19.440
going to return the rank he Moji that we care about.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.890
So ideally we get an emoji out of this.

04:23.150 --> 04:27.500
Let's save and run deploy here.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.790
Now I want this for production.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.390
So I'm going to change the tag.

04:32.400 --> 04:40.210
Now if I scroll up to prod just to see what happens and I'm going to run a Salles deploy.

04:40.770 --> 04:45.510
And while that's happening in the background we're going to work on the front end of our app of our

04:45.510 --> 04:46.420
smart brain up.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.900
But I want to go over this one last time.

04:48.900 --> 04:54.960
We have an array of emojis and all we're doing is based on the query string parameters that we get from

04:54.960 --> 05:04.010
the point that is going to be the rank of our entries our users entries we're going to just return a

05:04.010 --> 05:08.460
ranking Moji based on the order that we have in the array.

05:08.510 --> 05:11.970
We're simply receiving an input with the rag and Moji.

05:12.380 --> 05:19.120
So while that's being served up I'm going to go back to my Front-End looking at our app actually you

05:19.130 --> 05:22.120
want to have something in here next to our rank.

05:22.190 --> 05:28.820
So I'm going to go into our ranke component which luckily we already have.

05:29.350 --> 05:35.710
And then this Rand component we see that we're just logging out entries and that's about it.

05:35.710 --> 05:41.950
Let's add our emoji to this component actually before we start touching this list make sure that our

05:41.980 --> 05:44.590
lambda function works as intended.

05:44.590 --> 05:45.910
I'm going to go back.

05:45.940 --> 05:46.610
We see that.

05:46.630 --> 05:49.110
All right we have a new endpoint.

05:49.150 --> 05:57.400
You see that it's now Prada is in production and we can grab this and point and test out what we get.

05:57.440 --> 06:03.650
I'm going to copy and paste and in here because we're waiting for query string parameters that means

06:03.680 --> 06:06.310
we have to do a question mark for query strings.

06:06.440 --> 06:16.480
We're going to say that the rank equals we'll just give it let's say for now remember where we're getting

06:16.480 --> 06:17.100
this from.

06:17.110 --> 06:22.530
If we go back to our function we have the query string parameters and we're grabbing the rank property.

06:22.570 --> 06:30.890
If I name this to something different like the Moji well in that case I'll have to use the Moji over

06:30.890 --> 06:33.270
here after the question mark but let's give that a go

06:36.100 --> 06:37.230
look at that.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.440
Let's make that a little bit bigger.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.440
To celebrate we got the little winky face.

06:41.470 --> 06:43.660
Our service function is working.

06:43.900 --> 06:51.240
And if we change this to let's say 400 we get the rocketship we've got the rocketship badge and if we

06:51.240 --> 06:59.200
change this to zero smiley face we got to work on our ranch here.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.930
How awesome is that.

07:01.010 --> 07:07.320
And how simple was it to just deploy that function to lambda to Amazon servers.

07:07.450 --> 07:08.900
And now we have access to it.

07:10.110 --> 07:11.220
Absolutely amazing.

07:11.340 --> 07:12.120
I love LAMDA.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.560
I hope you're getting excited in the next video.

07:14.730 --> 07:18.930
We're going to implement this and the Front-End I'll see on that one.
