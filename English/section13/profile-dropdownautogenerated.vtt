00:01.340 --> 00:06.660
Welcome back let's add the dropdown ability to this profile icon.

00:08.370 --> 00:15.480
And luckily for us if we go back to react chape which we used and go to components that is nicely and

00:15.480 --> 00:24.740
easily done with the button dropdown we see over here that we need a few elements and I can even copy

00:24.740 --> 00:27.520
this entire piece of code.

00:27.590 --> 00:29.040
But let's go one by one.

00:29.060 --> 00:37.390
The first thing I want to do is I want to import some elements and let's space these out properly just

00:37.390 --> 00:38.230
so we can see them.

00:42.940 --> 00:43.830
Now that's better.

00:44.720 --> 00:48.970
And actually now that I go back we don't really want a button dropdown.

00:48.980 --> 00:52.780
We already have the button that is our avatar that's going to be the dropdown.

00:52.910 --> 00:58.250
So let's actually grab a simple dropdown over here without worrying about the button.

00:58.670 --> 01:04.490
Again I'm going to copy and paste this and let's change that up.

01:04.520 --> 01:08.690
So you want to make sure that you use only what you need.

01:08.840 --> 01:14.010
In our case looks like these four items is what we need.

01:14.020 --> 01:14.820
All right.

01:14.890 --> 01:23.770
And again going back to here we see that we need to have a steady state of dropdown open which we actually

01:23.770 --> 01:24.410
have.

01:24.700 --> 01:30.720
We need to bind this event and I'm going to talk about this in just a second.

01:30.910 --> 01:33.790
In case you haven't seen it before don't worry.

01:33.820 --> 01:37.130
We're going to talk about it.

01:37.250 --> 01:39.220
And let's just copy for now.

01:39.230 --> 01:43.360
This dropdown return component.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.150
I'm going to come down here.

01:45.430 --> 01:46.930
And for now just

01:51.730 --> 01:55.200
plop it in right after or right before our icon.

01:55.530 --> 01:55.750
All right.

01:55.750 --> 02:02.830
The first thing we want to check out is the is open which comes from this state dropdown open which

02:02.830 --> 02:03.770
we already have.

02:04.000 --> 02:11.320
And it also has a toggle function which we're going to get back to if we go down to dropdown toggle

02:12.370 --> 02:21.940
we have a few options and then our dropdown items as we can have a dropdown menu with our items.

02:22.190 --> 02:32.780
Now in our case well we have two items that we want we want view profile and we want Sign-Up we don't

02:32.780 --> 02:36.500
need any disabled ones and we don't need to worry about Hetter.

02:36.620 --> 02:41.290
And these are all things like this that have certain actions.

02:41.300 --> 02:48.670
We just want a normal another action WAHM which is over here without any attributes.

02:48.750 --> 02:51.670
So let's just remove all the ones that we don't need.

02:53.430 --> 02:55.920
And leave it at that.

02:55.970 --> 03:05.220
Now if I just save this like that I'm going to get a few error and one of the errors is going to be

03:05.220 --> 03:07.360
the fact that we're returning multiple things.

03:07.380 --> 03:10.220
Ideally these are wrapped in something.

03:10.230 --> 03:11.390
So let's wrap it all.

03:11.400 --> 03:17.590
Because remember with react to you want to return a single thing ordinary of elements.

03:17.640 --> 03:20.400
So I'm just going to wrap it in a div tag

03:23.090 --> 03:26.870
and with class name I'm going to give it some styling that again.

03:26.900 --> 03:30.080
I've tested it out already.

03:30.080 --> 03:37.460
So this is padding or for an text center because this isn't necessarily a CSSA course I'm using Tatiana's

03:37.700 --> 03:40.890
just to simplify things and not spend too much time on CSX.

03:40.940 --> 03:48.020
So if you ever see me typing these P-A for TCB search Tatian classes just automatically inject some

03:48.020 --> 03:50.350
nice CSSA for us so things look good.

03:50.390 --> 03:56.210
If you really want to know more about them than me just go to Tatiana's and they have great documentation

03:56.210 --> 03:57.880
that you can use.

03:57.880 --> 04:03.660
All right so this is now wrapped nicely in a div

04:06.810 --> 04:08.330
all right everything is working.

04:08.370 --> 04:17.780
If I go back now to my app so we have bind of undefined we haven't defined this Tuggle ability and that's

04:17.780 --> 04:24.960
because again if we go back to react Schrempp we have this toggle function.

04:25.220 --> 04:29.900
Again we can just copy it and the toggle function is very simple.

04:29.900 --> 04:33.820
It just sets state using the callback method.

04:33.920 --> 04:40.910
And this is just a way of anytime you update state you want to make sure that if you're ever within

04:40.910 --> 04:46.670
the update set state function you're touching the state because it can act in predictable ways.

04:46.670 --> 04:52.730
You want to have what we call a callback function where we make sure that we receive the previous state

04:53.330 --> 04:54.620
so that we can act upon it.

04:54.710 --> 05:00.470
In this case we're just saying that drop open we want to toggle it and we want to just turn it to the

05:00.470 --> 05:02.590
opposite of what it currently is.

05:02.690 --> 05:09.410
We're doing it this way because city state or state updates aren't actually run immediately as they're

05:09.410 --> 05:10.210
called.

05:10.640 --> 05:17.870
So we want to make sure that in order to avoid any buggy errors any time we're using state for an update

05:18.170 --> 05:28.070
you have this syntax of a callback function and this bind here is happening again because of a little

05:28.070 --> 05:32.460
quirk where this keyboard kind of gets messed around.

05:32.930 --> 05:38.450
And another way of doing this you'll see this in a lot of Riak project of using the bind to make sure

05:38.450 --> 05:40.620
that it binds to the component.

05:41.000 --> 05:49.070
But another way that I like doing it that it's a lot cleaner is to just use our functions and that's

05:49.070 --> 05:56.350
going to implicitly bind this for us and it just looks cleaner.

05:56.360 --> 06:06.540
Let's say that and go back right Legault that we have our dropdown menu that looks pretty nice but that's

06:06.540 --> 06:11.760
not really what rate we want to make sure that we can just click on the avatar and not have this drop

06:11.770 --> 06:13.310
down thing.

06:13.700 --> 06:21.870
Well luckily for us if we go back to our Riak trap if you scroll down there is an area called Custom

06:22.030 --> 06:28.960
dropdown content and you see over here I just created a custom content here and it just does dropdown

06:30.130 --> 06:31.710
and it's very simple to implement.

06:31.720 --> 06:41.560
We just simply use the dropdown toggle and put the dropdown toggle inside of the dropdown toggle whatever

06:41.860 --> 06:43.150
content we want.

06:43.150 --> 06:44.980
So I'm going to just copy this

06:50.010 --> 06:53.300
and instead of the dropdown toggle over here

06:56.460 --> 06:58.940
I'm going to paste this piece of code.

07:02.720 --> 07:06.570
And now this piece of code we can just keep it the way it is.

07:06.800 --> 07:15.050
But instead of the custom dropdown content we can perhaps insert our little icon that we have.

07:15.050 --> 07:19.340
So let's just grab the image or we can use the dev.

07:19.340 --> 07:25.830
Let's see what happens if we just add the dev again in our custom dropdown component.

07:26.030 --> 07:28.500
Make sure everything is aligned nicely.

07:29.510 --> 07:35.370
Let's save go back to our app.

07:35.590 --> 07:39.370
The clicking is not working.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.620
What happened here.

07:40.930 --> 07:42.530
Well let's go back.

07:42.540 --> 07:46.480
Well the first thing that I notice here is that I'm using class instead of class name.

07:46.550 --> 07:51.020
And remember we want to make sure that for react we use a class name.

07:51.170 --> 07:58.220
And I bet if we open up the terminal and let's make this a little bit bigger it looks like property

07:58.220 --> 07:58.540
class.

07:58.530 --> 07:59.990
Did you mean class name.

08:00.470 --> 08:01.700
So let's fix that.

08:01.700 --> 08:07.070
I also see that since we're using this div up here we don't really need to do a padding.

08:07.100 --> 08:11.390
We want the image to be a little bit higher and we can just remove the div

08:14.850 --> 08:21.880
and again for the class make sure that we use class name.

08:21.890 --> 08:28.790
Let's go back and again let's make sure that everything is working and figure out why the dropdown toggle

08:29.240 --> 08:30.920
isn't working right now.

08:30.920 --> 08:41.650
Again going back and if we actually go over here we'll see that we're doing something strange if we

08:41.650 --> 08:42.410
go.

08:42.520 --> 08:50.070
We see that there's a toggle call on the dropdown as well as a dropdown toggle that has an on click.

08:50.310 --> 09:00.300
And if we actually console like here what is happening let's just say this is state DOT state DOT dropped

09:00.350 --> 09:12.160
down open and I go back and open up the console and I click once I get this called twice.

09:12.560 --> 09:16.610
And this is a really funny thing with their documentation.

09:16.610 --> 09:19.580
You see that for the custom dropdown content.

09:19.580 --> 09:29.910
They're actually doing the set state in the toggle function to just do the typical accessing the state

09:29.980 --> 09:33.760
inside of the set state function which you actually don't want to do.

09:33.840 --> 09:42.510
And their workaround is to actually do this but I recommend instead to just remove this on click function

09:43.200 --> 09:45.340
because this is already happening.

09:45.810 --> 09:55.160
And in that case if I go back and I click this only happens once and you see that.

09:55.290 --> 09:55.770
Oh yeah.

09:55.820 --> 10:00.730
Now our profile is working and we've got a nice little toggle.

10:00.730 --> 10:01.510
How cool is that.

10:01.510 --> 10:03.220
That is nice and simple.

10:03.220 --> 10:06.950
Now let's remove the logging.

10:08.830 --> 10:12.280
And you can experiment yourself to see how that works.

10:12.280 --> 10:21.070
Again if you just pull back the click and add the this state DOT drop down and just update the object

10:21.620 --> 10:23.420
it'll work that way.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.750
But this is just a cleaner way of doing it.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.620
I recommend you do it this way as well.

10:27.640 --> 10:35.080
You can read up about using state inside of Seth state more on your own time is just a good practice

10:35.080 --> 10:36.300
to have.

10:36.310 --> 10:36.970
All right.

10:36.970 --> 10:41.920
We have the dropdown functionality but the styling is kind of off.

10:41.950 --> 10:46.210
So let's just fix that so instead of having it all the way up here it's a little bit lower maybe you

10:46.210 --> 10:47.830
have some see through next to it.

10:49.100 --> 10:56.540
Oh I have a few class name for us that we can use in the class or two dropdown menu.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.720
I can give it a class name.

10:58.810 --> 11:06.440
Again using Tatiana's I'll say that it's going to be a transparent background.

11:06.520 --> 11:11.260
It's going to have a shadow so gives it that 3D feel.

11:11.310 --> 11:17.620
A5 and then just to show you how it's done in case we wanted the styling as well.

11:17.620 --> 11:22.200
We can also do or we want to have our own styles.

11:22.210 --> 11:25.390
I can't just have a style attribute here.

11:25.420 --> 11:27.940
And let's just give it a margin.

11:28.400 --> 11:38.860
Top of 20 pixels began just to bring it down a bit and I want some transparency so let's just say that

11:38.860 --> 11:44.090
we want background color.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.340
Let me just move this on a new line.

11:46.340 --> 11:46.870
There you go.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.730
That's a lot cleaner.

11:49.830 --> 11:55.590
And again because this is javascript we don't do the dash color like we do with CSSA it's camel case

11:56.410 --> 12:03.400
and background color is going to be let's just give it the fall or this has to be a string.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.740
We'll do an R G B.

12:05.790 --> 12:12.070
So we can have some transparency and we'll do 2:55 2:55 2:55.

12:12.240 --> 12:21.290
So it's going to be white with 0.5 Alpha which is transparency.

12:21.290 --> 12:23.530
All right let's save that and see if that works.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.240
Let's have a look.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.250
All right look at that.

12:26.290 --> 12:28.090
That looks a lot better doesn't it.

12:28.090 --> 12:30.400
Like I said I kind of cheated with selling here.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.630
I've done it before hand.

12:31.630 --> 12:35.220
I usually like to code live and debug with you as I go.

12:35.220 --> 12:39.430
But when it comes to styling is just one of those things that it's nice to have before hand.

12:39.430 --> 12:45.070
You can play around and add your own styling as you want but you know what this is looking pretty nice.

12:45.070 --> 12:47.470
I'm pretty happy with how we have things.

12:47.500 --> 12:52.720
I think we need to add some functionality though so that when we click these things actually do something

12:53.040 --> 12:54.910
I will do that in the next video.

12:55.210 --> 12:55.990
I'll see on that one.
