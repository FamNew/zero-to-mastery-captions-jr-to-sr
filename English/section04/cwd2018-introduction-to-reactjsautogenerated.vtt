WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:07.520
A good job making it this far things are going to get more and more fun starting in this section because

00:07.760 --> 00:15.470
we're now learning real tools that real companies use and that will get you hired in 2018 and devolvement

00:15.500 --> 00:23.490
also becomes a lot faster because we're using these tools to make us build web sites faster and better.

00:23.490 --> 00:28.670
So let's talk about re-act What do we have before we act.

00:28.780 --> 00:36.840
Well as I've mentioned before we had Jay queery Jake where he was as you remember very imperative writing

00:36.840 --> 00:41.090
code was like mixing ingredients sequentially.

00:41.220 --> 00:44.420
If this happens then do this and then do that.

00:44.430 --> 00:50.020
But also if this happens then do this and it creates a lot of inconsistency.

00:50.250 --> 00:57.990
And if you remember the DOM manipulation section Well that is really really difficult and constantly

00:57.990 --> 01:06.230
keeping track of what changed and what to change is a huge mess and it creates for a very slow development.

01:06.690 --> 01:12.780
And as your website gets more and more complex it becomes very very hard to scale which means it becomes

01:12.780 --> 01:16.290
very hard for teams of developers to manage it.

01:17.400 --> 01:24.000
Now re-act was created at Facebook as you know Facebook is a pretty big app and a lot of things need

01:24.000 --> 01:25.620
to happen for it to work well.

01:25.770 --> 01:33.180
And they had this problem and the creator react as a way to solve this issue and be able to have a tool

01:33.240 --> 01:39.360
that allows him to build web sites in a nice predictable way that you can have multiple developers working

01:39.360 --> 01:40.580
on it at the same time.

01:42.370 --> 01:45.210
And I like to use the analogy of a bread machine.

01:46.290 --> 01:47.900
Using re-act is kind of like that.

01:47.910 --> 01:58.910
You just throw in the ingredients and react does all this magic underneath the hood and puts out a website.

01:59.020 --> 02:06.980
So it's very reliable and very consistent and it does one thing really really well and that is the view

02:07.550 --> 02:17.050
it manages to make our Web sites the DOM change in predictable ways that is easy to scale and easy to

02:17.050 --> 02:17.780
manage.

02:18.610 --> 02:24.640
And the beauty of re-act is that because it's just the view it doesn't necessarily mean it's only for

02:24.640 --> 02:25.520
browsers.

02:25.960 --> 02:32.150
As a matter of fact a reactor can be used with mobile devices to build native apps.

02:32.170 --> 02:40.120
It's used in virtual reality apps you can build desktop apps with re-act anywhere that has a view well

02:40.210 --> 02:41.260
react can use it.

02:41.290 --> 02:48.400
And big companies as I mentioned before Facebook and Instagram use react and Netflix users react whenever

02:48.400 --> 02:52.700
you browse through movie choices Well that's using re-act underneath the hood.

02:52.990 --> 02:57.100
It's a very very useful tool and in very high demand.

02:57.160 --> 03:03.310
So I'm excited to talk about react and teach you this valuable skill in this section.

03:03.310 --> 03:09.340
Now in order to understand re-act there's a few things that we want to go over and these are principles

03:09.340 --> 03:14.760
that are very valuable that have been learned over the years by developers.

03:14.770 --> 03:21.320
One is the idea of thinking in components up to this point we've just built websites.

03:21.570 --> 03:27.170
Everything is just one javascript file one CSSA file one ASTM Alpha.

03:27.330 --> 03:34.310
But wouldn't it be nice if the web was a network of these small components.

03:34.320 --> 03:41.130
Think of them as Lego blocks where everybody builds a specific Lego block and you just combine these

03:41.130 --> 03:44.650
Lego blocks to create your website.

03:44.730 --> 03:50.850
That is the idea that re-act established let's use this as an example.

03:50.850 --> 04:00.750
You first have atoms which as you can see here are icons and little small and divisible elements on

04:00.750 --> 04:03.300
your website such as images.

04:03.420 --> 04:07.720
There's some tax and you divide these into atoms.

04:07.740 --> 04:15.990
From there you form molecules or combine atoms that have similar functionality such as the navigation

04:15.990 --> 04:16.960
bar down here.

04:17.040 --> 04:25.220
You combine individual atoms to out some functionality and then you have organisms again a little bit

04:25.220 --> 04:29.420
bigger than molecules that combines to a bigger scale functionality.

04:29.510 --> 04:31.790
And then finally have templates.

04:31.790 --> 04:37.900
The combination of these organisms to give you an idea of how your app or website should look.

04:37.910 --> 04:43.050
Finally you have your pages that is the page of your app.

04:43.290 --> 04:52.600
And if you think in components as this image demonstrates what you're able to build small little components

04:53.140 --> 04:58.130
that you can reuse and put on different parts of the webpage.

04:58.210 --> 05:05.110
For example this backbone here if I build a re-act component that is the backbone I can now use that

05:05.110 --> 05:06.550
on multiple pages.

05:06.550 --> 05:13.030
And I don't have to rewrite the code if I wanted the navigation bar to be used in different areas of

05:13.030 --> 05:13.540
the app.

05:13.540 --> 05:19.640
Well again I don't need to rewrite the code I write at once and I can reuse it as a matter of fact even

05:19.660 --> 05:20.970
shared with the world.

05:21.250 --> 05:28.820
And this idea of components makes react to Maisy because right here I have a Web site that has three

05:28.840 --> 05:32.240
components built by somebody and we can reuse these.

05:32.440 --> 05:36.160
And it's not just CSX and a shemale.

05:36.280 --> 05:42.280
But real functionality such as navigation bars and signing forms.

05:42.280 --> 05:51.400
I can just download this Riak component and attach it to my website and because of the way react to

05:51.400 --> 05:56.640
structured it doesn't really need to know about the rest of the web page is just its own local block

05:56.830 --> 06:02.280
that works by itself by reducing dependencies on other parts of the Web site.

06:02.530 --> 06:06.340
I can just plug this anywhere I want.

06:06.350 --> 06:10.740
Another important concept with React is the idea of one way data flow.

06:12.340 --> 06:19.150
The best way to describe it is by looking at this tree like structure in here you see that we have a

06:19.150 --> 06:25.060
parent some children and then those children have their own children and those children have their own

06:25.060 --> 06:25.570
children.

06:26.600 --> 06:34.190
And the idea with reactors that data flows from top to bottom and never the other way around that is

06:34.520 --> 06:38.310
if these red let's call them components change.

06:38.480 --> 06:44.120
Well in that case only their children know about the change.

06:44.120 --> 06:50.570
The parents don't really care about the change because well the direction of the data flow is just always

06:50.570 --> 06:51.420
downstream.

06:51.440 --> 06:58.690
So we go back to the idea of components if we had a website build on components and this was the page

06:58.930 --> 07:06.270
and these were organisms and then molecules than atoms.

07:06.330 --> 07:11.050
In that case the red components change and then only the ones below it.

07:11.070 --> 07:18.240
As you can see here in blue know of this change and based on that they will act accordingly and change

07:18.240 --> 07:19.120
as well.

07:19.290 --> 07:25.770
Now without actually having a problem it's hard to understand this concept but trust me this is a very

07:25.770 --> 07:29.450
important concept that re-act brought in.

07:29.460 --> 07:35.820
It creates a lot of really nice bug free code and it is an idea that you'll understand more and more

07:35.850 --> 07:41.250
as we start to code and react.

07:41.490 --> 07:49.560
The next thing is the idea of virtual dog you know what the Dahmus the document object model.

07:49.680 --> 07:54.900
And we also learned that one of the most important things as a developer is to minimize the amount of

07:54.900 --> 08:00.960
dumb manipulation that we do because well web browsers has to have to work really really hard to achieve

08:00.960 --> 08:05.240
that and it reduces the performance of the web page plus increases.

08:05.250 --> 08:11.110
But I think this image demonstrates what react as really well beforehand.

08:11.150 --> 08:15.800
We were the painters we told the dorm exactly what to do.

08:15.860 --> 08:23.130
Remove this element then put this in and then also add this and color this this way with react.

08:23.150 --> 08:29.940
We have this re-act bought and the Riak back create something called the Virtual dog virtual Dom is

08:30.020 --> 08:36.970
just a javascript object and this javascript object that just describes our website.

08:37.260 --> 08:45.180
The current state of the Web site and we just give it that object to react and then react by it will

08:45.270 --> 08:53.160
automatically make changes to the Dom and paint the picture in the most optimum way possible.

08:53.190 --> 08:56.420
So we just tell it hey this is the object.

08:56.580 --> 09:02.910
This is what we want and the DOM and the re-asked takes care of Dom manipulation for you.

09:02.910 --> 09:10.560
Remember how annoying it was to do Quesada luck to all then grab aliments by id and then doing all these

09:10.710 --> 09:14.390
event handlers will react takes care of that.

09:14.400 --> 09:22.380
So again the virtual Dom is just a copy of the dom that's in a javascript object and they react underneath

09:22.380 --> 09:28.860
the hood just changes the view and that's why it's able to work outside of browsers and you can use

09:28.860 --> 09:33.740
things like VR and and mobile devices because react as the machine.

09:33.750 --> 09:35.330
And what the Camus's on.

09:35.350 --> 09:38.910
Well we can change the canvas to whatever we want.

09:38.910 --> 09:43.620
Finally re-act has a great ecosystem.

09:43.700 --> 09:49.460
It is probably one of the biggest ecosystems and Javascript right now and there are so many tools that

09:49.460 --> 09:56.760
worked with re-act as a matter of fact the developer community is so big that any problem you have there

09:56.850 --> 10:02.200
is most likely a chance that somebody else has had it and has posted it on the Internet and you can

10:02.200 --> 10:03.560
find solutions for.

10:03.630 --> 10:09.730
You can find it react packages and 21:00 you can use it with Noad there's wetback in baseball that you

10:09.730 --> 10:10.820
can use with it.

10:10.960 --> 10:17.980
It's just a really good ecosystem that uses the latest javascript technology to build web sites in a

10:17.980 --> 10:20.440
really nice elegant way.

10:20.440 --> 10:26.700
Now one thing that I want to warn you about in this section we're going to see code like this.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.050
And it's going to look very strange at first.

10:30.220 --> 10:34.860
It's like the same way when you look at javascript the first dot.

10:34.980 --> 10:37.350
It seemed like a whole new different world.

10:37.350 --> 10:43.080
It will when you first look at this but trust me knowing what you know about javascript this becomes

10:43.170 --> 10:44.640
really really easy.

10:44.670 --> 10:51.710
You have classes that extends the Riak component and this is how we build components.

10:51.930 --> 10:59.970
We have constructor again that we've seen and advanced objects and then each class has a mandatory render

11:00.060 --> 11:03.840
function they you just tell it what this clock should render.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.930
And as you can see it looks like a male is in it.

11:07.350 --> 11:11.970
It's not exactly a male but the syntax is very similar.

11:11.970 --> 11:16.420
So even by looking at this you see that this clock component.

11:16.440 --> 11:20.110
Again this logo block just returns a Hello World.

11:20.130 --> 11:23.640
H-1 tag with an H2 that says it is.

11:23.640 --> 11:30.630
And then the time again just to give you a heads up you're going to hear words like props and state

11:30.750 --> 11:36.540
and Riak components but these are just language syntax so you'll learn.

11:36.810 --> 11:39.490
And it's actually quite easy once you get used to it.

11:39.840 --> 11:43.690
So don't worry this is all going to make sense.

11:43.800 --> 11:49.120
By the end of it you know what we're going to be building a pretty cool OP.

11:49.300 --> 11:57.120
It's called Brabo friends and we're going to build this app that well searches through your robot friends

11:57.630 --> 11:59.670
and you can find their contact information.

11:59.730 --> 12:02.970
And as you can see it updates live.

12:03.240 --> 12:04.680
It's super fast.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.400
It's responsive.

12:06.750 --> 12:08.540
It's going to be a lot of fun.

12:08.640 --> 12:14.920
And we're going to build this pretty fast just to show you how powerful react is.

12:14.970 --> 12:15.470
All right.

12:15.510 --> 12:17.790
I'm really excited to get into this section.

12:17.790 --> 12:19.350
You're going to have a lot of fun.

12:19.470 --> 12:20.970
I'll see you in the next one.

12:21.000 --> 12:21.270
Bye bye.
