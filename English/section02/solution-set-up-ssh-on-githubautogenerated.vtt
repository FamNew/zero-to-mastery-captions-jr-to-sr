00:00.450 --> 00:02.730
And welcome back.

00:02.730 --> 00:08.260
I hope you are able to solve that nice little simple problem to start off the course.

00:08.310 --> 00:15.690
I know we talked a lot about S-sh and your brain might be hurting right now but the simple act of using

00:15.720 --> 00:19.080
S-sh with good hub should really really make sense.

00:19.080 --> 00:22.250
Now we know exactly what we're doing right.

00:22.290 --> 00:29.040
If we wanted to connect to get Hobb and make sure that get hub trusts this computer that we're working

00:29.040 --> 00:29.550
on.

00:29.850 --> 00:36.950
Well we'll simply go into our S-sh folder.

00:36.980 --> 00:45.350
We'll look through some more of our keys and we see that we have a lot of keys but most of the time

00:45.350 --> 00:53.450
we can just use one generic one if you want a separate key for each one of your S-sh clients then that's

00:53.450 --> 00:55.230
up to you as well.

00:55.340 --> 01:00.340
If I wanted to connect to I could always do the Keiji and command

01:03.180 --> 01:09.510
and actually get a recommends generating your S-sh key if you don't have one like this.

01:09.510 --> 01:17.310
You can read about the parameters that they involve here and once you've created this key you simply

01:17.310 --> 01:26.040
as we know copy onto her clipboard and just to make sure that we're going to be using the ski weekend

01:26.040 --> 01:36.720
just to S-sh at with the key that we want to say we're using the regular one and once we've copied that

01:36.840 --> 01:38.310
we have everything set up.

01:38.310 --> 01:50.570
We go into settings within settings so we go to S-sh and we can add a new S-sh key we can call it whatever

01:50.570 --> 01:59.250
you want to distinguish it let's just say my laptop and I just copy and paste the key

02:02.020 --> 02:11.700
wants a click add S-sh all Olasky to confirm with your password and you'll see that the key right now

02:11.880 --> 02:14.730
that I've created is a block key.

02:15.120 --> 02:21.040
And in order to connect Initially you'll have to first try it out.

02:21.250 --> 02:28.680
So you can clone a repo and try your S-sh key and see if it all works.

02:28.680 --> 02:33.470
So again we have we can use S-sh to copy

02:36.810 --> 02:38.370
and let's just go to

02:42.110 --> 02:52.290
desktop and it's clear that and by the way just so you know to manage multiple identities like I have

02:52.770 --> 02:55.080
I can just do S-sh and

02:57.580 --> 02:58.300
dash.

02:58.390 --> 03:02.200
Hell is going to give me a list of all identities that I have.

03:02.400 --> 03:11.810
If I do slow Dashti it removes all the identities and now I can just simply do as I say.

03:12.060 --> 03:18.660
Add this to the new Digital Ocean to the entity that I created.

03:18.660 --> 03:26.370
Again if I do as a sage add dash L I see that this is my identity that I created.

03:26.490 --> 03:38.160
And now if I get clone or repo it's a little report that I have I'm able to clone it using S-sh and

03:38.160 --> 03:44.230
you can see over here that the key is now green means it's all working very cool.

03:44.360 --> 03:44.820
OK.

03:44.840 --> 03:53.360
Now to summarize everything we all know what's happening with S-sh now and the cool thing about it is

03:53.360 --> 03:57.620
that we now have a way to communicate with any server that we want.

03:57.770 --> 04:05.150
Theoretically if he had let's say five different computers let's say are raspberry pies you can do something

04:05.150 --> 04:23.780
like S-sh with this command and enter into a server and then from there you can S-sh into the next computer.

04:23.780 --> 04:31.530
If you really know the path and so on and so on just by doing this you hop from one computer to the

04:31.530 --> 04:38.420
next tunneling yourself to your destination computer which is very very cool.

04:38.550 --> 04:40.700
I think it's called anyway.

04:40.830 --> 04:42.540
I hope you enjoy that section.

04:42.540 --> 04:45.940
Things are going to get even more fun after this.

04:45.960 --> 04:49.410
We're going to be using S-sh later on in the videos as well.

04:49.410 --> 04:54.450
But now that we have a nice foundation we should feel comfortable on our first day of the job.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.830
I'll see in the next one by.
