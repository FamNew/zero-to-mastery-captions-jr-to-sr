Hey it's Bruno here.

00:03.050 --> 00:09.050
Listen I think it's time for us to move you to our main flagship product smart brain.

00:09.080 --> 00:14.870
I mean I know it's early and you just started at the company but you've done such fantastic work and

00:15.260 --> 00:22.550
Roble friends is great and all but our big money maker is the smart brain app that uses machine learning

00:22.550 --> 00:26.710
to detect people's faces in pictures and everybody loves it.

00:26.780 --> 00:33.800
Now it's a lot bigger code wise than Roble friends and more complicated but using the smart brain app

00:33.830 --> 00:40.900
we can do some really cool things like replacing faces with emojis blurring faces and other neat tricks.

00:40.910 --> 00:47.360
And I think we need somebody with your talents on the project Listen to start off can you get the project

00:47.360 --> 00:53.450
set up on your machine for development and also add a few features for us.

00:53.450 --> 00:56.450
Currently our smart brain app can only detect one face.

00:56.450 --> 00:58.610
Can you make it so it detects a lot more.

00:58.760 --> 00:59.290
Cool.

00:59.300 --> 01:00.320
Thanks.

01:00.340 --> 01:01.670
P.S. great 10.

01:01.700 --> 01:03.300
You must have spent the weekend at the beach.

01:03.380 --> 01:05.620
I'm jealous.

01:05.660 --> 01:06.440
All right.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.650
We're getting promoted to a bigger project.

01:08.660 --> 01:09.660
That's good.

01:09.680 --> 01:12.880
The smart breaking up is going to be a lot of fun for us to work with.

01:12.890 --> 01:14.460
So it's time to get to work.

01:14.840 --> 01:21.510
We're going to have to set up the database the server and the front end up all by ourselves.

01:21.530 --> 01:25.700
We're going to have to review the smart Browncoat and then implement a feature.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.500
It's going to be another fun section.

01:27.560 --> 01:28.780
So let's get started.
