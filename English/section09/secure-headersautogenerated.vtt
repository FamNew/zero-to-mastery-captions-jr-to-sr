00:01.330 --> 00:09.730
As we've mentioned before header's or HTP headers are really really important in telling the browser

00:10.000 --> 00:12.880
what to do with some of the contents that we've delivered.

00:13.240 --> 00:18.720
And sometimes to tell servers what to do as well with these should be requests.

00:18.730 --> 00:24.910
There are a ton of them and I'll leave a resource for you to read up on them because it is the it is

00:24.940 --> 00:27.010
outside of the scope of this course.

00:27.550 --> 00:32.500
But you're going to really really like me because I'm going to make this process super simple for you.

00:33.310 --> 00:39.420
To have secure headers in something like an express up that's all we need to do.

00:39.420 --> 00:46.180
Again these are problems that everybody has on their apps so there exists packages that help you make

00:46.180 --> 00:47.330
things easier.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.430
So we just need NPM install helmet.

00:51.430 --> 00:53.090
Now let me show you how it works.

00:54.960 --> 01:02.120
If I go back to my app here and let's minimize this for now so we can see everything let's just see

01:02.270 --> 01:05.570
what happens without helmet being used.

01:05.570 --> 01:14.800
I'm going to type something in here and let's open up the Network tab and just send some jibberish.

01:14.800 --> 01:15.260
All right.

01:15.260 --> 01:17.480
I get my secret

01:20.170 --> 01:28.870
and I see in my headers that I have all this little information oh look at that I have information that

01:29.170 --> 01:33.690
this Web site is powered by Xpress.

01:33.730 --> 01:40.750
Now that might not seem like important information but to a knowledgeable hacker maybe now I can Google

01:40.880 --> 01:48.670
him vulnerabilities and express and maybe if I haven't updated my express server that bad actor can

01:48.940 --> 01:51.210
now use those vulnerabilities against me.

01:51.430 --> 01:58.270
And there's many many headers like that that really affect the security of the app.

01:58.540 --> 02:06.520
And we have this great package called Hammad that I install on every server that I built and helmet

02:06.670 --> 02:14.050
as you can see helps you secure your express apps by setting various headers and there's tools for things

02:14.110 --> 02:21.520
other than express but Express is generally the most common and most well documented in the community.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.480
And as you can see here it's quite easy.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.420
So let's just copy and paste this.

02:28.490 --> 02:31.100
I'm going to install Helmut.

02:31.110 --> 02:43.300
Let's go back here and PM install Helmut and we can just include it as helmet equals require

02:46.320 --> 02:46.920
helmets.

02:46.920 --> 02:47.820
Perfect.

02:47.820 --> 02:56.990
And then if we look at the documentation right after app equals Express we can just use Helmut again

02:57.030 --> 03:05.890
and another middleware So we're intercepting the TBs and adding or modifying the headers.

03:05.900 --> 03:13.890
Remember instead of doing this type of thing where we have to set the headers helmet does this for us.

03:14.240 --> 03:15.860
So fight save.

03:16.180 --> 03:24.080
Ron NPM start and go back to our app and let's just refresh here.

03:24.370 --> 03:29.380
And I'm just going to submit something else.

03:29.390 --> 03:35.780
All right I get a nother seeker request but check this out.

03:35.780 --> 03:43.540
There's no X par by any more but we have all these headers such as cross-site scripting protection free

03:43.610 --> 03:48.710
options download option DNS prefetch control Content-Type options look that.

03:48.710 --> 03:54.370
We even have have a strict transport security Max Saige.

03:54.740 --> 03:57.050
That's a law of things.

03:57.050 --> 04:04.250
And you know what hametz sets all of this for us if we scroll down you see you can click through all

04:04.250 --> 04:12.340
of these and shows you what gets set and what gets set by default because some of these things they

04:12.340 --> 04:16.650
don't set so that you have some some freedom to adjust them.

04:16.900 --> 04:22.360
But out of the box just by running helmet without doing any configuration we have all of these guards

04:22.390 --> 04:23.800
in place.

04:23.800 --> 04:31.990
For example H.S. TS or strict transport security that we saw over here.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.410
Where was it.

04:33.420 --> 04:34.680
There you go.

04:34.710 --> 04:44.100
This says that with this website we're only going to allow AC DC s on the server and it redirects any

04:44.790 --> 04:53.370
calls made by this client to CBS and has max age which says I want you to remember this for this much

04:53.370 --> 04:55.560
time and this feels like it's a year.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.410
It's a long time.

04:56.760 --> 05:05.030
And the high powered by option that's the X powered by header that was removed.

05:05.070 --> 05:09.050
Remember it showed Xpress because of Helmut.

05:09.050 --> 05:09.700
There you go.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.610
Nice and simple solution.

05:11.690 --> 05:15.530
You can go ahead and read up on all of these and other security headers.

05:15.590 --> 05:23.360
But Helmut honestly covers a big chunk of these issues and if you have helmet as part of your app while

05:23.360 --> 05:24.850
then you're pretty much set.

05:26.240 --> 05:29.470
You see I told you this was going to be a nice and easy video.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.570
I think we deserve that every once in a while.

05:32.570 --> 05:33.140
All right.

05:33.230 --> 05:34.560
I'll see you in the next one.

05:34.560 --> 05:35.020
Bye bye.
