Hey so I noticed a quick error in my logic that I had to fix.

00:05.530 --> 00:13.890
And right here in the rank in Moji whenever it gets to 9 because of this logic over here we'll actually

00:13.890 --> 00:15.120
get on define.

00:15.120 --> 00:24.120
So we need to add the equal sign over here and now we should be able to run through our ranks properly.

00:24.130 --> 00:25.660
I've already deployed this fix.

00:25.660 --> 00:27.160
So let's give it a go.

00:27.430 --> 00:32.030
If I was a new user let's call let's say it's Jenny.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.370
And Jenny has the e-mail.

00:35.780 --> 00:41.960
G-mail dot com and the password is always a sign in.

00:42.160 --> 00:44.270
Hey Jenny here's my rank badge.

00:44.350 --> 00:51.400
I'm also going to let's just play around and update Jenny's name to Sally.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.540
Let's save that.

00:52.630 --> 00:53.510
That's great.

00:53.560 --> 00:58.090
And I have a new image that I'm going to test out with our clarify API.

00:58.610 --> 01:03.900
It's the Rumanian national soccer team logo that detects all the faces that's kind of cool.

01:03.910 --> 01:08.700
Now as I click this check out the rank badge.

01:08.880 --> 01:10.000
All right it's changing.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.530
Look at that.

01:11.550 --> 01:12.780
We got a lot of eyes.

01:12.810 --> 01:14.500
We got some diamonds.

01:14.520 --> 01:18.510
We got the rocket ship you go.

01:18.520 --> 01:19.830
Everything is working.

01:19.840 --> 01:22.360
Nice and smooth.

01:22.360 --> 01:23.650
Good job everybody.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.180
I'll see in the next one.

01:25.250 --> 01:25.890
Bye bye.
