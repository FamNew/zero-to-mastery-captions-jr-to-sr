00:01.010 --> 00:09.530
Welcome back in our discussions about Bandler's and especially well-packed I wanted to also talk about

00:09.530 --> 00:16.610
something called parsel which is a new butler that has come out in response to some of the issues that

00:16.910 --> 00:26.120
you might face with wet back and that is mainly the fact that configuration is really really complicated

00:26.690 --> 00:28.360
with wetback.

00:28.640 --> 00:35.580
Parcells says hey I'll make things really really fast and we don't need any configuration files.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.980
I'll take care of everything for you which is really nice.

00:39.180 --> 00:43.040
And I personally want this to keep going.

00:43.040 --> 00:51.140
I think configuration can get really tedious and doesn't really necessarily improve your developer skills.

00:51.140 --> 00:58.100
So I definitely am a big fan of parsel so I'm going to do a quick demo on how parsel works.

00:58.130 --> 00:59.010
Let's have a look.

01:00.600 --> 01:08.000
I have over here a folder that I created that is completely empty and we're going to set up parsel to

01:08.000 --> 01:09.060
start off.

01:09.140 --> 01:10.730
We know we want to create or react.

01:10.790 --> 01:17.830
So I'm going to say NPM install react and also react on

01:21.800 --> 01:22.450
perfect.

01:22.460 --> 01:24.840
We also want to actually NPM in it.

01:24.920 --> 01:31.820
So we have a package dodgiest on file and we see over here that all right we have all our packages so

01:31.820 --> 01:32.480
far.

01:32.480 --> 01:33.650
Let me be clear here.

01:35.380 --> 01:42.650
And now let's just have a few more things that we saw in the previous video on wipeout.

01:42.820 --> 01:52.690
Let's NPM install dash test saved dev the parsel button there.

01:52.710 --> 01:56.300
So this is what's going to bundle our code.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.140
We're going to also get babbel

02:00.880 --> 02:04.370
preset and that we've talked about previously.

02:04.600 --> 02:23.020
And then let's also add because we're using re-act baseball preset re-act and hit enter.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.150
All right.

02:24.150 --> 02:33.550
So we've got everything set up the other thing I want to do is let's create our baseball configuration

02:33.550 --> 02:34.090
here.

02:34.090 --> 02:38.010
But actually let's try and do a baseball RC file.

02:38.030 --> 02:44.400
So again something that we mentioned in the previous video I can just touch and Previously we did the

02:44.490 --> 02:49.910
Slint RC this time around we can just do baseball.

02:50.280 --> 02:59.770
RC And again this is going to read the baseball RC fall when initiating our project and configure Babbel.

03:00.110 --> 03:10.500
In our case we want to have our pre-sets need the double quotes pre-sets to have the presets we just

03:10.500 --> 03:11.280
downloaded.

03:11.280 --> 03:16.320
We have the end and we have the re-act.

03:16.430 --> 03:19.990
And finally let's go into our package.

03:20.030 --> 03:24.820
Jasonville and look at our scripts.

03:24.840 --> 03:33.740
So in here we want to say that we want to start and instead of this jibberish with parsel we can just

03:33.740 --> 03:38.170
say parsel index dot HMO.

03:38.660 --> 03:44.080
So we want to start bundling and parcel is smart enough to know that.

03:44.300 --> 03:48.140
Just give me the index start small and I'll take care of the rest for you.

03:48.590 --> 03:52.840
So for now let's just create the index not a shemale File.

03:53.020 --> 04:06.360
We're going to touch index dot HMO and once again I'm going to make a nice small a small file and here

04:07.390 --> 04:15.460
let's have a div where we have the ID up for our entry to react.

04:15.990 --> 04:25.250
And then finally a script dag that will have the source of nice and simple and stodginess

04:32.090 --> 04:33.140
and an index.

04:33.250 --> 04:42.770
Yes let's create that follows wall I can just right click here for now and I'll just say new file.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.540
Let's try that again.

04:45.420 --> 04:47.420
New file index Dot.

04:47.540 --> 05:01.520
Yes and we'll import will import re-act from the re-act package that we installed will also import re-act

05:02.000 --> 05:10.480
Dom from re-act Dom and let's create a simple component that says

05:13.170 --> 05:21.990
hello and this component will just be quite simple and just return for us.

05:22.910 --> 05:24.790
Actually I can just keep it all online.

05:24.830 --> 05:31.190
It's going to return a two.

05:31.220 --> 05:32.220
I've said that enough.

05:32.220 --> 05:33.820
Let's try something else.

05:33.870 --> 05:35.640
Let's go with what's up.

05:40.580 --> 05:40.920
All right.

05:40.940 --> 05:48.080
And again in order to add that to our index thought a shemale binded to the idea of app we can simply

05:49.040 --> 05:50.190
do react.

05:50.220 --> 05:50.760
Dom

05:54.970 --> 05:57.820
This should be dom like this.

05:58.050 --> 05:58.700
Rupes.

05:58.710 --> 05:59.790
There you go.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.490
Render.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.240
And we want to render the halo component

06:06.880 --> 06:12.020
in the document dot get element by id

06:14.710 --> 06:15.520
app.

06:15.520 --> 06:16.260
Perfect.

06:16.540 --> 06:20.220
Let's save that we have a simple app here.

06:20.500 --> 06:25.850
Let's make this a little bit smaller so you can see now just for fun.

06:26.290 --> 06:35.710
Let's run NPM start NPM start.

06:35.750 --> 06:39.020
All right what just happened.

06:39.040 --> 06:43.150
I see that I have a server running at HDB localhost.

06:43.180 --> 06:44.410
One two three four.

06:44.620 --> 06:45.500
Let's give it a try.

06:45.580 --> 06:46.540
Let's see what's there.

06:54.630 --> 06:56.770
Oh and silly me.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.820
Remember this is a component.

06:58.910 --> 07:02.010
So it is GSX.

07:02.020 --> 07:06.310
After all we need to run this safe.

07:06.430 --> 07:08.080
And did you notice that.

07:08.080 --> 07:08.910
Let me try that again.

07:08.950 --> 07:14.580
Save and parcel rebuilt everything for me.

07:14.580 --> 07:23.810
If I go back and refresh look at that we have everything printed onto the screen.

07:23.940 --> 07:29.720
But the cool thing is that our set up time was really really fast.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.710
We didn't have to configure anything.

07:31.990 --> 07:41.020
The cool thing with parsel is that it's zero configuration you see automatically parsel knows that it's

07:41.020 --> 07:46.470
going to look at index dot a shemale file and starts working from there.

07:46.660 --> 07:53.650
If index thought James had more imports and more components All-Starr loading them and bundled them

07:53.740 --> 08:00.190
together and it's going to put everything into a disk folder that it already created look good that

08:00.550 --> 08:12.740
we have a parcel js file and even source maps so parcelled does all of this for you.

08:12.740 --> 08:16.600
It's smart enough to just figure out everything on its own.

08:16.940 --> 08:23.530
You see that in the disk folder the script now points to the parsel number.

08:23.550 --> 08:24.760
Dodgy Yes.

08:24.790 --> 08:32.110
Again matching the Jazz file that it's output it.

08:32.190 --> 08:40.620
How cool is that with so you can't really get up and running super fast and still get the bundling that

08:40.620 --> 08:41.700
you need.

08:41.730 --> 08:48.150
Obviously it doesn't have the flexibility that what pack has but it's moving the community in the right

08:48.150 --> 08:52.220
direction in the direction of having configuration as a second thought.

08:52.220 --> 08:58.620
Something that's taken care of and what Pak has noticed and a with web pack for you are able to have

08:58.620 --> 09:00.310
a lot less configuration.

09:00.390 --> 09:01.490
They did before.

09:01.680 --> 09:04.470
But again definitely keep an eye out on this package.

09:04.470 --> 09:10.860
I think it's absolutely amazing that we can do this so fast and creator of re-act up this fast with

09:10.860 --> 09:11.460
parcel.

09:11.970 --> 09:13.340
I hope this was interesting.

09:13.500 --> 09:16.860
Now go play around with this package and explore on your own.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.430
I'll see you in the next one.

09:18.550 --> 09:18.810
Babai.
