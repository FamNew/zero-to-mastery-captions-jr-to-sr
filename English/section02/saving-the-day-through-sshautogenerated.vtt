00:00.940 --> 00:01.740
Welcome back.

00:01.870 --> 00:04.500
Let's try a little bit of an exercise here.

00:04.610 --> 00:13.270
I'm going to call the server that I have up here something more exciting like super awesome app.

00:13.320 --> 00:14.490
Just do that.

00:16.720 --> 00:23.780
Now while this is loading I want to go through the experience of getting a call in the middle of the

00:23.780 --> 00:27.450
night again something that actually happened to me before.

00:27.950 --> 00:34.380
And you get a message saying the app somehow got deleted on the server.

00:34.850 --> 00:42.170
Can you upload it and have the app running again because users can't access the website.

00:42.560 --> 00:47.280
So I'm going to show you the basics of what to do in that scenario.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.860
So we have our super awesome app here.

00:51.060 --> 00:56.470
And if we remember we can just access it through S-sh.

00:56.490 --> 00:59.720
So let me minimize this.

00:59.910 --> 01:09.300
And over here we can just from our desktop S-sh to our route and remember our IP address over here.

01:09.540 --> 01:10.710
Hit enter.

01:11.040 --> 01:18.420
We are now inside of the boun to server that we have bought with the Digital Ocean.

01:18.420 --> 01:25.290
All right let me clear this just so we can see a little bit better now because this is a Linux operating

01:25.290 --> 01:26.970
system on the server.

01:27.060 --> 01:33.610
We need to install get if I Taiping get here.

01:33.640 --> 01:33.900
All right.

01:33.900 --> 01:40.920
Looks like the get command exists but sometimes that may not be the case in which case we'll have to

01:40.920 --> 01:54.690
do apt or sudo apt get an apt get is a a way to install packages on the Ubuntu box and you can think

01:54.690 --> 02:01.410
of it it's a little bit similar to and PM if you used NPM before or home brew if you've used Mac before.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.660
We just want to install things.

02:02.660 --> 02:07.840
So if I do sudo apt app dash get get it.

02:07.920 --> 02:16.390
And I have to do install then you can see over here that I'm able to install it which is great.

02:16.400 --> 02:23.690
All right so let's say that we have the app on our Get help page and for this example I'm just going

02:23.690 --> 02:29.010
to go to our 0 2 M.E. open source projects that students have contributed to.

02:29.180 --> 02:34.960
And I'll just click on the travel guide and we'll say I'll say that the travel guide.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.530
That's the one that we want to clone.

02:36.710 --> 02:49.000
Well in that case I can go in here and say get clone the repo and I'll say yes and actually we'll get

02:49.000 --> 02:57.980
an error here because well permission is denied because we don't have S-sh set up with get how yet so

02:57.980 --> 03:15.740
again going back here I'm going to use a piece copy to clipboard and try that again.

03:15.760 --> 03:16.430
All right.

03:16.580 --> 03:27.600
If I go LS now we see that we have our travel guide and we can go into our travel guide project.

03:27.810 --> 03:36.820
And again if I ls there we see that we have our little app and all the files that we need onto the server.

03:36.900 --> 03:37.820
How cool is that.

03:39.090 --> 03:47.660
And here if we wanted to if this was accessible we can also do Appian install and you see that and PM

03:47.660 --> 03:48.890
is currently not installed.

03:48.890 --> 03:51.310
So again what do we do in this situation.

03:55.930 --> 04:01.820
So now we can just run the no GIs and everything will be installed.

04:01.990 --> 04:12.640
Nice and easy and we'll see that no ass is now working on our server and we can do obviously the same

04:12.640 --> 04:16.040
with NPM run NPM install if we wanted to.

04:16.060 --> 04:20.100
Anything to get our app back up and running.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.120
But like I said before I don't want to get hung up on all these commands.

04:24.130 --> 04:28.900
These are things that would stack overflow dot com or Google.

04:28.900 --> 04:35.950
You can figure out again these are just commands that were able to run just like we can on our own computer

04:36.340 --> 04:37.870
onto a remote server.

04:37.870 --> 04:43.690
Another thing I wanted to show you is let's say that we have a super awesome app dot com over here just

04:43.690 --> 04:46.140
like I have on my desktop by the way.

04:46.270 --> 04:48.120
Pretty nice background today.

04:48.530 --> 04:54.270
Anyway let's say that within here we have our index script and style file.

04:54.280 --> 05:00.150
So just our Web site and we want to bring it up to our Ubuntu box here.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.600
All right so let's say.

05:02.750 --> 05:05.350
So the first thing we want to do is we want to exit out of here.

05:05.350 --> 05:10.840
We see that we've logged out we're back to our desktop our own computer and here I have installed a

05:10.840 --> 05:13.030
command called our sync.

05:13.030 --> 05:21.130
So let's just see the end to super awesome dot com and from here we'll just say our sync

05:24.220 --> 05:27.150
and we're going to copy all the files in this directory.

05:27.370 --> 05:30.320
You can read up about these syntaxes online.

05:30.400 --> 05:35.940
It's very important for this video just the fact that I'm copying anything recursively in this folder.

05:36.130 --> 05:43.290
And we're going to copy it into our IP address.

05:43.410 --> 05:44.850
Our Ubuntu box

05:47.920 --> 05:54.840
and we're going to put it in a folder called super awesome dot com.

05:54.850 --> 05:55.400
All right.

05:55.510 --> 06:04.390
So now if we S-sh got to our box and I clear this and let's check out what we have.

06:04.390 --> 06:06.190
We have super awesome dot.

06:06.220 --> 06:16.380
If I cd into super awesome dot.com I see that I have my index script and style file all up into our

06:16.440 --> 06:19.730
server somewhere out there in New York.

06:19.740 --> 06:20.320
Awesome.

06:20.520 --> 06:22.320
So there's that power of S-sh.

06:22.320 --> 06:29.260
We're just able to transfer files and take command of a server somewhere else in the world.

06:30.010 --> 06:31.180
Very cool.

06:31.180 --> 06:32.760
I'll see you in the next one.

06:32.880 --> 06:33.140
Babai.
