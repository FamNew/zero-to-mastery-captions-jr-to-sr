Holy smokes it's Bruno here and you've done once again a fantastic job.

00:08.930 --> 00:14.180
Kaikohe Corp. has seen so much improvement since you've come on board and now you've even improved our

00:14.180 --> 00:15.220
processes.

00:15.230 --> 00:18.490
You're just a super super rockstar.

00:18.650 --> 00:20.430
Seriously we can't thank you enough.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.070
Everybody's excited about you.

00:23.090 --> 00:27.070
I think a promotion is coming very very soon for you.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.750
Let's recap what we've just learned.

00:30.880 --> 00:38.080
If you test and deploy code more frequently it will eventually reduce the risk level of the project

00:38.110 --> 00:38.990
you are working on.

00:39.070 --> 00:45.970
As you can detect bugs and code defects earlier this means they are easier to fix and you can fix them

00:46.030 --> 00:46.780
sooner.

00:46.780 --> 00:54.520
Which makes it cheaper to fix them when you have a C.I. process in place that is hooked into a continuous

00:54.520 --> 00:57.430
delivery system or workflow.

00:57.490 --> 01:04.340
It's easy to share your code and deploy your code regularly this code sharing helps to achieve more

01:04.340 --> 01:08.080
visibility and collaboration between team members.

01:08.210 --> 01:14.770
And eventually this increases the speed and efficiency within your organization.

01:15.080 --> 01:16.220
To recap.

01:16.220 --> 01:23.240
Start writing tasks for the critical parts of your codebase get sea service to run those tasks automatically

01:23.240 --> 01:30.140
on every push to the main repository at any other tests and steps to make sure we minimize errors and

01:30.140 --> 01:36.880
make sure that your team integrates their changes every day and any time the belt is broken.

01:36.950 --> 01:44.020
Fix it as soon as possible and in the end if you follow this process then no matter what your size.

01:44.270 --> 01:50.320
How many lines of code and how many team members you're going to be able to have a successful project.

01:51.330 --> 01:52.150
I'll see in the next one.
