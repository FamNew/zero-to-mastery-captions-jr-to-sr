00:01.110 --> 00:09.950
Let's talk about complexity versus simplicity this is something that is really important that is not

00:09.950 --> 00:11.120
often talked about.

00:11.450 --> 00:17.390
I left this until the end of the course because you won't truly appreciate it and understand it unless

00:17.450 --> 00:21.970
you have all the previous knowledge from the videos.

00:22.010 --> 00:27.380
In my career I have met a lot of great developers engineers and leaders.

00:27.380 --> 00:31.620
They had many great traits and they were all great programmers.

00:31.760 --> 00:38.730
However they had one major thing in common that separated them from all the other Iver's developers.

00:38.900 --> 00:42.410
And I don't even think they realized they had it.

00:42.690 --> 00:45.940
It's something so simple that it is often overlooked.

00:46.090 --> 00:50.650
And in this video I want to go over this and something that I truly believe can help you in your career

00:51.550 --> 00:55.770
and that is always choose simplicity over complexity.

00:56.950 --> 01:02.230
I know that's a bold statement but as you progress through your career you'll find yourself learning

01:02.440 --> 01:06.480
more and more becoming more and more confident.

01:06.670 --> 01:10.660
You start making sense of complex computer science topics.

01:10.660 --> 01:17.180
You'll start to sometimes scoff at junior developers that are asking silly questions.

01:17.220 --> 01:18.950
First off never do that.

01:19.170 --> 01:22.230
You were that junior developer once too.

01:22.230 --> 01:31.080
So was everybody else always accept questions but inevitably you will want to show off your skills sometimes

01:32.440 --> 01:37.680
you may try and make coding choices that make people say wow he or she is so smart.

01:37.690 --> 01:42.110
Or I have no idea what they just quoted but it looks so cool.

01:42.130 --> 01:43.540
This is not good.

01:43.570 --> 01:50.560
Too often I see developers choose complex options or coding styles in order to seem smart and capable

01:51.340 --> 01:57.380
or just use a cool new function or trick that they recently learned.

01:57.390 --> 02:06.430
Now the secret that the best developers I know use is that they always choose simplicity over complexity.

02:07.220 --> 02:12.020
Writing code isn't a measure of how smart you are and how many things you know.

02:12.020 --> 02:16.450
Writing code is about creating something that is of good quality.

02:16.450 --> 02:18.120
What do I mean by that.

02:18.260 --> 02:21.320
Good code is self documenting.

02:21.530 --> 02:27.990
It is easy for someone new to come in look at your code and understand what it does.

02:28.160 --> 02:32.920
Right away good code also minimizes bugs.

02:32.930 --> 02:38.630
It allows people to not add bugs on top of it because it's clear and concise.

02:38.630 --> 02:45.710
It's easy to read simplicity in code is making your code readable as if you just reading an English

02:45.710 --> 02:48.260
manual.

02:48.330 --> 02:51.420
But wait sometimes you do have to write complex code.

02:51.450 --> 02:58.710
Not every person is going to be able to understand your code and that is true but complexity and simplicity

02:59.250 --> 03:02.410
is on a spectrum not binary.

03:02.430 --> 03:06.040
It's not either simplistic or complex.

03:06.150 --> 03:08.100
That means it's not right or wrong.

03:08.250 --> 03:09.440
Black and white.

03:09.630 --> 03:17.160
It's all about trying to minimize the complexity of your code as much as you can remember although we

03:17.160 --> 03:19.310
write code to speak with machines.

03:19.530 --> 03:24.690
Machines that work to communicate and make our lives easier.

03:24.690 --> 03:32.220
So next time you write code take a deep breath say to yourself what can I do to make this code simple

03:32.550 --> 03:37.390
for anyone to understand while still maintaining my goal.

03:37.440 --> 03:38.940
I don't need to show off.

03:38.950 --> 03:41.620
I am aware of what I know and what I can do.

03:41.670 --> 03:51.380
Let me write code that is easy to understand for people to understand to always choose simplicity over

03:51.380 --> 03:52.040
complexity.
