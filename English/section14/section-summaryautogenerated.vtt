Hey it's Bruno here once again I'm so impressed with your work.

00:05.310 --> 00:09.790
I love this a slam what's going to save us a ton of money and in the long run.

00:09.840 --> 00:13.050
And I think the ranking system people are going to really really use it.

00:13.170 --> 00:14.280
Thanks again.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.650
Always appreciated.

00:15.690 --> 00:27.940
You're just the absolute best well well well we managed to incorporate AWOS their web services and use

00:28.270 --> 00:34.150
the server less framework to actually have Amazon lambda functions.

00:34.150 --> 00:35.670
How cool was that.

00:35.680 --> 00:44.530
I hope you had a ton of fun and you have a great idea of how all the systems work in our smart pre-snap

00:44.770 --> 00:48.370
we've done an incredible amount of work on it.

00:48.370 --> 00:56.950
We've created sessions using retests and JWT tokens we've used docker to make our devolvement processes

00:57.070 --> 00:57.930
easier.

00:58.000 --> 01:05.200
We've added profile abilities ability for us to have protected routes and obviously we've added the

01:05.560 --> 01:13.120
Amazon lambda function for our ranking system and I hope we have a really nice picture of how you can

01:13.120 --> 01:19.390
now construct as a developer all these different pieces to accommodate your project.

01:19.390 --> 01:26.410
That's the beauty of being able to manage projects is that you have the big picture vision and you understand

01:26.410 --> 01:32.730
how these little pieces can be placed together to customize to your liking.

01:32.860 --> 01:39.790
And once you start thinking and these big picture terms of adding bits and pieces from each components

01:39.790 --> 01:45.820
and libraries and that's when you really start to be able to have a lot of power and creation and a

01:45.820 --> 01:47.340
lot of flexibility.

01:47.500 --> 01:51.390
And this is the work that we're going to do on our smart brain up.

01:51.400 --> 01:58.490
There's so many things that we can add we can maybe use as three to upload profile images for our users.

01:58.510 --> 02:04.300
We can definitely refactor the code and I'm sure there's bugs and fixes here and there that we can make

02:04.300 --> 02:05.000
to it.

02:05.060 --> 02:10.450
And as you've watched me code if you started to realize that we can do that better we can fix that better.

02:10.600 --> 02:11.290
That's good.

02:11.290 --> 02:17.110
You're thinking like a senior developer trying to fix and improve little small details to eventually

02:17.110 --> 02:19.580
have a nice clean product.

02:21.650 --> 02:27.080
And I'm going to leave the smart brain App project for you to play with to extend if you want to add

02:27.080 --> 02:33.230
new functionality or we can change the functionality completely and just keeping the small pieces together.

02:33.260 --> 02:39.470
I wanted to explore and share with the community in our Dischord server to see what you can come up

02:39.470 --> 02:40.410
with.

02:40.430 --> 02:47.570
I hope you had fun and we have just a few more sections to close out the scores before you move on to

02:47.570 --> 02:48.800
the next section though.

02:48.950 --> 02:55.610
I want to see how creative you can get with Amazon lambda functions as an exercise try and build something

02:55.610 --> 03:00.470
really really exciting and share it with me on our chat channel.

03:00.470 --> 03:01.850
I want to know all about it.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.930
All right I'll see you in the next section.

03:06.050 --> 03:07.170
We're almost there.

03:07.190 --> 03:08.300
Keep it up.

03:08.360 --> 03:09.790
I'll see you soon.

03:09.800 --> 03:10.360
Bye bye.
