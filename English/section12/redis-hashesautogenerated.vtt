Welcome back the next data type we're going to talk about again we've covered strengths the next datatype

00:08.140 --> 00:17.370
that exists in red S are called hashes and hashes are maps between string fields and string values.

00:18.510 --> 00:24.930
And the best way to think about them are simply like objects just like in javascript we have objects

00:25.500 --> 00:27.680
Rhetors hashes are very very similar.

00:27.690 --> 00:39.410
Let me demonstrate I can set a hash type datatype by saying H am sat and now within here I guess a user

00:42.940 --> 00:47.820
id let's say forty five name

00:51.080 --> 00:54.280
let's go with Johnny.

00:54.410 --> 01:07.290
And here we've just created a hash with a key user and this key has both id of 45 and name of Johnny.

01:07.310 --> 01:19.940
So if I do H get hash GED and I do ID and that doesn't work because I have to say what is the hash that

01:19.940 --> 01:24.010
is what is the key that is identifying this object.

01:24.080 --> 01:29.180
So it would have to be a get user ID and I get 45.

01:29.300 --> 01:40.890
If I do get a user name I get John and if I do something like H get all and I just give them the key

01:42.120 --> 01:49.560
look of that I get all the identifying criteria of the user.

01:49.620 --> 01:55.820
Again a good way to think about hashes and redness is simply it like javascript objects.

01:55.830 --> 01:58.280
All right let's talk about lists in the next video.
