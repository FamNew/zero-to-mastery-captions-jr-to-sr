00:00.870 --> 00:08.040
Welcome to the complete junior to senior web developer roadmap. By the end of this course you will no

00:08.040 --> 00:10.870
longer be a junior developer.

00:10.890 --> 00:19.020
My name is Andre and I'm the instructor of the highest rated Web development course on day with hundreds

00:19.020 --> 00:21.190
of students joining my previous course.

00:21.360 --> 00:28.380
Each day I have spent years consulting and working as a senior developer for the biggest tech firms

00:28.380 --> 00:30.610
in Silicon Valley and Toronto.

00:30.960 --> 00:38.050
I've also consulted for published books as well as startups but this is about you.

00:38.130 --> 00:44.460
In this course you will learn all the modern technical skills that senior developers know that work

00:44.460 --> 00:50.910
for the biggest tech companies like Google, Airbnb, Netflix, and many others.

00:51.030 --> 00:54.160
You see I've been in your shoes before.

00:54.360 --> 00:57.390
You never feel like you're a good enough of a programmer.

00:57.540 --> 01:03.990
You feel like you're always playing catch up to people smarter than you. That you are an imposter pretending

01:03.990 --> 01:09.330
to be a web developer and you feel like you'll never get to the point that some of the other senior

01:09.330 --> 01:10.490
developers are.

01:10.980 --> 01:18.570
You see a mountain and you don't know how you're ever going to climb it to the top. Think of this course

01:18.690 --> 01:19.640
like a bootcamp.

01:20.160 --> 01:25.640
By the end of it you will have employable skills that are in high demand.

01:25.930 --> 01:31.980
Unlike a bootcamp though you'll never need to apply for a junior developer role again.

01:32.020 --> 01:37.930
Instead of spending thousands of dollars learning in an environment where things move too fast.

01:38.160 --> 01:45.960
Watching somebody else code along and not fully understanding the why of each topic. This course

01:45.960 --> 01:52.460
on the other hand is something you can do your own pace with meaningful exercises that solidify your

01:52.460 --> 01:55.900
knowledge with projects you can put on your portfolio

01:56.000 --> 02:02.130
at the end of the course. Instead of learning skills that will mark you as a junior developer, you'll

02:02.130 --> 02:08.940
be learning skills that will set you apart that any company would want. You will learn to think critically

02:09.690 --> 02:16.280
with the big picture in mind. I'm not going to teach you the coolest and the hippest way to write a javascript

02:16.310 --> 02:22.040
function that nobody understands and isn't useful other than just to show off.

02:22.070 --> 02:28.790
No. I'm going to teach you how to structure projects, how to have successful projects, and how to connect

02:28.790 --> 02:35.780
the dots for all the technologies that are out there for web developers. All things that senior developers

02:35.870 --> 02:44.510
know. This course is going to follow a storyline where you are hired at a new company along the way.

02:44.510 --> 02:50.300
Your boss will take you through real life scenarios and tasks that you will have to accomplish as a

02:50.300 --> 02:51.620
developer.

02:51.620 --> 02:54.310
This way you're learning practical skills.

02:54.410 --> 02:58.110
Each section that you can implement in real life.

02:58.250 --> 03:05.860
And yes, these are all scenarios I have encountered myself in the industry. This course is your answer

03:06.040 --> 03:14.200
to finally feel admired, respected by others, and confident in your skills and hopefully by the end of

03:14.200 --> 03:15.950
it get a higher salary.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.110
Here's the secret.

03:18.200 --> 03:25.570
Most junior developers and beginner programmers have the capability to become really good developers.

03:25.970 --> 03:32.630
However they don't have a trusted source of information to tell them what to spend their time on, what

03:32.630 --> 03:39.270
are the good practices, and the bad practices why these tools are good and what tools are bad.

03:39.620 --> 03:46.580
Instead they hope that they gain their knowledge here and there through trial and error slowly and slowly.

03:47.990 --> 03:53.660
Instead I want to give you a fast track and give you all the knowledge that I have learned over the

03:53.660 --> 04:01.970
years in the industry in a clear and concise way because the most complex topics are built on top of

04:02.000 --> 04:05.230
basic ideas that anybody can understand.

04:06.820 --> 04:13.450
The course will be focused on connecting the dots on all of these so that next time you are in an interview

04:13.930 --> 04:20.680
you can speak intelligently about current tactics for building projects, architecture, and setting up

04:20.860 --> 04:22.870
developer environments.

04:22.870 --> 04:27.530
My goal is to give you the most efficient path to becoming a senior developer,

04:27.850 --> 04:32.540
instead of wasting your time on the wrong things.

04:32.630 --> 04:39.080
If I was starting a company today and wanted top quality developers, these are the skills that I would

04:39.080 --> 04:47.980
hope you have to learn about performance optimizations, react and redux, with typescript securing your

04:47.980 --> 04:56.060
apps, testing your apps, Docker, session management, and much much more.

04:56.060 --> 05:01.520
Don't worry if you don't know all these terms. By the end of this course, you're going to be miles ahead

05:01.580 --> 05:03.360
of most web developers.

05:03.530 --> 05:11.300
You'll feel confident to have the skills to lead projects, make project decisions and possibly even train

05:11.510 --> 05:19.130
junior developers. I'm so confident in this course that if you don't find any value after watching the videos and

05:19.130 --> 05:25.390
following along with exercises you can have a full refund within 30 days of signing up.

05:25.460 --> 05:30.220
I hope you'll join me to learn the skills that will set you apart as a web developer.

05:31.130 --> 05:37.910
This course has over two hundred HD videos and we also have a private online chat room with thousands

05:37.910 --> 05:43.040
of students now working and helping each other out every day to get better.

05:43.040 --> 05:50.600
Finally think of this as a constantly evolving course. As I do with all my courses will be kept up to

05:50.600 --> 05:57.590
date as new practices emerge so you can make sure you're learning the most current and relevant skills

05:57.650 --> 06:06.530
in the industry. Remember what you are going to do today that other people won't, will allow you to do

06:06.530 --> 06:12.710
tomorrow what other people can't. Be better than a junior developer.

06:13.160 --> 06:19.840
Wherever you are wherever you are this is the path to becoming a senior developer one day.

06:20.390 --> 06:26.360
Have a look at the course outline and the next video to see if this course is right for you.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.210
I'll see you inside.
