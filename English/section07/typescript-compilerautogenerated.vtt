00:01.000 --> 00:02.070
Welcome back.

00:02.320 --> 00:07.230
It's time to set up our environment to work with typescript.

00:07.570 --> 00:14.570
Now as with anything that I mention in this course I do recommend you check out their documentation.

00:14.800 --> 00:20.440
They have really really good information of why you can do why you can use.

00:20.650 --> 00:27.970
And if we go back to what it says we've now learned what this statement below means typescript is a

00:27.970 --> 00:33.050
typed superset of javascript that compiles to plain Javascript.

00:33.280 --> 00:36.640
So let's download it and we could click here.

00:36.640 --> 00:40.120
But for me we're developers Let's use a terminal

00:43.970 --> 00:45.790
Let's make this a little bit bigger for you.

00:48.050 --> 00:53.760
In order for us to work with typescript we have to make sure that we have a node installed and I'll

00:53.780 --> 00:58.210
leave resources for you to install node after this video.

00:58.430 --> 01:04.550
But a good way to check if you have node available on your computer is to do dash the I have a point

01:04.550 --> 01:10.790
9.1 and you can follow along and make sure as long as your version of node is higher than this all the

01:10.790 --> 01:11.850
code should work.

01:12.760 --> 01:18.240
Now why do we need node to work with typescript.

01:18.790 --> 01:27.320
Well if you remember in our diagram typescript has this little machine this compiler that compiles our

01:27.320 --> 01:37.010
code to javascript and this compiler needs to run somewhere and this compiler again has to have an environment.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.070
And that's what we use for.

01:39.200 --> 01:47.050
For being able to run javascript because it has the javascript engine that is the V-8 engine that actually

01:47.050 --> 01:53.460
comes from Chrome to actually read our javascript and understand it.

01:57.960 --> 02:01.090
So let's download this compiler.

02:01.530 --> 02:06.780
All we need to do is run NPM install dash G for global.

02:06.780 --> 02:15.530
That means that we can use the typescript command now in our terminal and just type typescript and based

02:15.530 --> 02:20.820
on your permission writes You might have to run this with sudo.

02:20.900 --> 02:28.420
So that is giving it permission to install where you might have to type in your password and then you'll

02:28.420 --> 02:32.390
get typed script downloaded on your machine.

02:32.620 --> 02:33.310
Perfect.

02:33.310 --> 02:34.230
Nice and simple.

02:35.160 --> 02:45.330
Now we're able to run typescript from our terminal and the way we do that is do ts see for typescript

02:45.360 --> 02:46.270
compiler.

02:46.590 --> 02:51.910
If I press enter here let's make this a little bit bigger.

02:52.110 --> 02:54.650
You see that it gives us all the information we need.

02:54.720 --> 03:04.590
I have version 2.0 1.3 and it tells us how we can work with this compiler.

03:04.610 --> 03:11.510
So now that we have the compiler installed we can start writing typescript put it through this compiler

03:12.440 --> 03:20.810
and this compiler is going to spit out javascript and through that method we're able to add static typing

03:20.810 --> 03:28.990
to javascript something that javascript doesn't have naturally and its definition.

03:29.060 --> 03:29.760
All right.

03:29.760 --> 03:33.060
So go ahead and get this set up on your machine.

03:33.060 --> 03:35.960
I'll leave resources for you to follow along.

03:36.210 --> 03:43.110
So that for the next upcoming videos you're typing along with me and testing out your type Skipp compiler

03:43.110 --> 03:43.520
works.

03:43.530 --> 03:45.720
And that we're writing typescript together.

03:46.290 --> 03:48.090
I'll see in the next video by.
