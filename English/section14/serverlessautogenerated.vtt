00:02.030 --> 00:08.450
Welcome back let's install the Servilius framework so we can start playing around with Amazon Lamda

00:08.660 --> 00:13.230
and incorporate that feature of the batch system into our smart brain.

00:13.490 --> 00:22.430
The first thing we need to do is run NPM install Server less with the dash G command.

00:22.430 --> 00:27.280
Now G is for global and we've used the before.

00:27.280 --> 00:32.170
This gives us access to server less throughout our entire computer globally.

00:32.230 --> 00:39.760
So you might have to add sudo in front of this command to make sure that you have access to a global

00:39.760 --> 00:40.490
package.

00:40.480 --> 00:42.220
Make sure you get your password right.

00:44.440 --> 00:47.410
And server less is going to install for us.

00:47.530 --> 00:53.920
And like I said server this is going to take care of all the configuration on a yes for us all we have

00:53.920 --> 01:01.120
to worry about is our own code and a little bit of YAML configuration that won't be too bad.

01:01.360 --> 01:05.870
So let me clear this and test out our command.

01:05.900 --> 01:11.410
Let's run the server less.

01:11.450 --> 01:12.130
All right.

01:12.150 --> 01:15.650
And it gives us a nice output of all the commands we can have.

01:15.870 --> 01:17.330
And it's actually quite nice.

01:17.340 --> 01:24.660
We see that we could run deploy we could run create we can run logs all these different things to monitor

01:24.870 --> 01:27.360
our service application.

01:27.360 --> 01:36.850
For example if we're interested in the command server less create we can also do dash dash help and

01:36.860 --> 01:39.400
get more details about that command.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.430
And let me make this a little bit bigger.

01:42.270 --> 01:42.970
We see that.

01:42.990 --> 01:43.430
OK.

01:43.500 --> 01:49.620
It's creates a new service service and it tells us what kind of options we can have the spacing right

01:49.620 --> 01:57.170
now is a little bit off because I made this the size of the text a little bit big but it looks fairly

01:57.170 --> 01:58.120
nice and easy.

01:58.160 --> 02:07.100
We see that with the commands we can do yes no gas act must script AWOS Python and have different templates

02:07.100 --> 02:08.510
to work with.

02:08.510 --> 02:14.210
All right let's clear this up by the way there's a shorthand version that you can use which is s.a less

02:14.450 --> 02:19.120
so you don't have to type server less over and over which kind of gets exhausting after a while.

02:21.350 --> 02:28.020
Now what we want to do here is simply write a Salles create and give it a template.

02:28.700 --> 02:31.200
Or you can do Dashti as well.

02:33.530 --> 02:38.990
And we'll say that our template that we're going to use is going to be called AWOS and this I got from

02:39.020 --> 02:42.830
the help function that I just ran called node.

02:42.980 --> 02:47.930
Yes I'm going to be running no js so I can code in javascript.

02:47.930 --> 02:49.050
I'm going to press enter.

02:50.380 --> 02:51.410
And look at that.

02:51.460 --> 02:57.220
We get a nice little output and we've successfully generated boilerplate template.

02:57.220 --> 03:01.680
You can see that on my desktop I now have a good ignore file handler.

03:01.770 --> 03:02.120
Yes.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.660
And a server less YAML file.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.060
So let's open this up.

03:08.090 --> 03:12.580
I'm going to you know what I'm going to put this inside of a folder just so it's a little bit cleaner.

03:12.590 --> 03:17.730
I'm going to make directory we'll call this rankly

03:21.160 --> 03:29.660
and we have this little folder here that we can just move all our files into.

03:29.870 --> 03:37.790
That's a lot better was just seeding into our little rankly app and open up sublime text and see what

03:37.790 --> 03:38.830
we can do here.

03:43.090 --> 03:43.430
All right.

03:43.450 --> 03:44.440
That's a lot better.

03:45.770 --> 03:51.750
Now in here we have our good ignore file which is pretty standard.

03:51.800 --> 03:59.390
We have a handler dodgy us which if we actually take a look is the exact same function or similar to

03:59.390 --> 04:03.110
what we had on the dashboard.

04:03.110 --> 04:12.300
The Hello function which takes an event a context and a callback and we see that and here our callback

04:12.300 --> 04:21.000
simply says callback and we give a response of status 200 and a Jason that says Go serve less.

04:21.210 --> 04:23.180
And with the input event.

04:23.310 --> 04:30.670
So this is where we're going to be writing our event or our function and then finally we have the YAML

04:30.670 --> 04:34.000
file and they have really really good documentation here.

04:34.180 --> 04:40.130
And these are the configurations that you can have on a yes and we'll go into that a little bit.

04:41.530 --> 04:49.630
But we see that so far we have highlighted that we're using A.W. s no known as the provider is going

04:49.630 --> 04:59.050
to be AWOS and we're using the run time six point ten which looks like we wanted the earlier version

04:59.050 --> 05:05.130
of or the later version of Romley because on the dashboard we selected 8.10.

05:05.450 --> 05:09.030
So we might need to update that everything else.

05:09.220 --> 05:15.070
We see those there's also functions that is the hello and the handler for it is handler.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.640
Hello again handler.

05:16.640 --> 05:17.260
Dodgy Yes.

05:17.270 --> 05:24.410
Has the hello we're going to go a little bit more into detail in the next video.

05:25.330 --> 05:27.180
I'll see that one by.
