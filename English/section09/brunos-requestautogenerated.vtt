Hey it's Bruno here.

00:03.150 --> 00:06.550
Looks like you're starting to get comfortable around Kaikohe Corpora.

00:06.780 --> 00:08.600
Glad to see you enjoying yourself.

00:08.790 --> 00:16.140
Hey listen I just got out of a meeting with our CEO and he's really concerned about security in our

00:16.140 --> 00:17.960
products being hacked.

00:18.270 --> 00:23.520
I heard you have some experience with security auditing and I was wondering if you could do a little

00:23.880 --> 00:29.810
audit for us and improve our security best practices maybe update our guidelines.

00:30.050 --> 00:30.650
Yeah.

00:30.870 --> 00:31.160
All right.

00:31.170 --> 00:31.790
Thanks.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.170
You're awesome.

00:33.300 --> 00:39.060
By the way Grace Miles always I like your attitude oh boy.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.580
Here we go again.

00:40.840 --> 00:47.740
It's time for us to update the security policies and guidelines at Kaikohe Corp. So they don't become

00:47.770 --> 00:52.950
victims of data breaches viruses and other bad things.

00:52.960 --> 00:55.720
This is going to be a really fun topic.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.120
It's one of my favorites.

00:57.370 --> 00:59.050
So let's get into it.

00:59.200 --> 01:06.340
And by the end of it we can update Keiko Korps security policy and make it a modern company that is

01:06.340 --> 01:08.740
smart about its security.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.020
I'll see in the next video.
