00:01.870 --> 00:02.980
Welcome back.

00:03.250 --> 00:07.720
Now that you have a doctor set up and doctor is running.

00:07.720 --> 00:17.710
Let's go to our smart brain API project which I have over here and build a sample doc Rafal and we're

00:17.710 --> 00:24.760
using this project because by the end of this section we're actually going to build a docker file for

00:24.820 --> 00:26.480
this entire project.

00:26.650 --> 00:35.670
So to start off what we need to do is to well first of all let's close this server for now.

00:35.670 --> 00:36.700
There you go.

00:36.820 --> 00:45.810
And what we need to do is to first build an image an image file that or can read and the way we do that

00:45.840 --> 00:50.030
is by creating a new file at the root of our project.

00:50.070 --> 00:53.430
So I'm going to say actually I'm just going to do it here.

00:53.450 --> 01:02.190
I'm going to say touch and we have to call this docker file and this Daka file will be our image.

01:02.270 --> 01:08.570
So if I hit Enter Here we see that we now have a doc file in our project.

01:08.570 --> 01:14.020
So let's open this up and this is completely empty right now and that's fine.

01:14.120 --> 01:21.560
Now in here if you remember we can include images that I showed you in or hub that other people have

01:21.560 --> 01:22.210
been.

01:22.490 --> 01:27.830
So for example we want node to be running on this project.

01:27.830 --> 01:30.840
Let's see our node version for our smart brain up.

01:30.890 --> 01:35.270
If I do no dash fee I see that it's a point nine point one.

01:35.270 --> 01:38.740
All right let's go to Dr. Haab which I have it up over here.

01:38.840 --> 01:41.090
And let's check out node

01:44.710 --> 01:53.530
and we want to run a version we see that has the lead of the latest version of version 8 which is fine

01:53.530 --> 01:54.010
for us.

01:54.010 --> 01:55.670
It's also called carbon.

01:55.690 --> 01:59.010
So if I click here I see that.

01:59.010 --> 02:05.030
Oh yeah that's a docker file but I just need the node carbon or node.

02:05.240 --> 02:14.360
This specific version for now we can just say from with capital letters and we're going to just go ahead

02:14.360 --> 02:18.370
and say a node carbon and that's it.

02:18.370 --> 02:23.080
So we're saying just grab the node carbon image

02:25.960 --> 02:34.410
and I can put on here the version number and any of these tags that you see that you want for your project.

02:34.510 --> 02:41.110
And then finally I'm going to do a nother command called CMT that stands for command and in here it's

02:41.110 --> 02:47.590
going to be an array of commands that we want to run after we grab the node version.

02:47.600 --> 02:54.960
So all I'm going to say is Ben Bash and I'll show you what that does in a second.

02:54.980 --> 03:03.290
Now the first command as I said before tells docker to use the node image from or hub again the official

03:03.290 --> 03:05.240
daquiri image repository.

03:05.570 --> 03:10.250
And this is what we call a parent image of our image.

03:10.250 --> 03:19.410
Now the CMD or command instruction tells us what to run in the container which allows us to access its

03:19.680 --> 03:24.160
bash profile again something that I'm going to show you will make more sense later.

03:24.180 --> 03:32.120
Now let's go to our terminal make sure we save this file and I can run now the command docker again

03:32.220 --> 03:35.680
that comes with the docker install that we just had.

03:36.360 --> 03:41.000
We just say docker build and give it a tag name.

03:41.070 --> 03:46.620
So Dasht T is for tag and we can say whatever you want we'll say.

03:46.620 --> 03:51.800
Super awesome container.

03:51.910 --> 03:59.390
And once I press enter and here's a little trick because we have to tell it what to build.

03:59.420 --> 04:03.710
We we have to give it a period at the end so build all.

04:03.830 --> 04:09.800
And the current directory is going to find a doc or file and there you go.

04:10.260 --> 04:13.710
It's running everything running everything you see over here.

04:13.830 --> 04:16.710
It's doing the From note carbon.

04:16.720 --> 04:20.750
Step 2 the command that we just said.

04:20.970 --> 04:27.990
And it says successfully built and successfully tagged the super awesome container.

04:28.060 --> 04:35.230
This just created our first daquiri image with the tag name using the dark profiled that we just currently

04:35.620 --> 04:36.160
had.

04:36.190 --> 04:42.410
And again I ran this command from the root directory which is where our doc file is located.

04:45.020 --> 04:46.670
Now that took a bit of time.

04:46.790 --> 04:55.010
If I have run this command again see how much faster that was and that's because instead of downloading

04:55.100 --> 05:02.240
Noad all over again like it did the first time around Dockers going to use the cached image or remembers

05:02.240 --> 05:02.790
the image.

05:02.930 --> 05:05.290
So it becomes a lot faster.

05:05.450 --> 05:09.770
And now let me clear this we can do something fun.

05:09.860 --> 05:17.380
We can do the instead of Dr. Bill now which we just did we do Dr. run and Daco run.

05:17.390 --> 05:20.400
We have to give it a few parameters.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.370
And then the name of our container.

05:22.370 --> 05:29.170
So let's say the super OSS can take care that we created

05:31.890 --> 05:32.460
Whoa.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.540
Do you just see that.

05:34.370 --> 05:41.490
We just ran our docking container and it took us to our container.

05:41.490 --> 05:44.000
Now you see that my terminal is completely different.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.160
We're inside the container.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.000
Now why did it do that.

05:50.040 --> 05:53.280
Because we just ran our docker container.

05:53.580 --> 06:03.580
And if you remember our command was to do bin bash and this comment simply says to go into the bash

06:03.760 --> 06:11.000
profile that is the Ben bash of our container and you see over here that we have root at some hash.

06:11.080 --> 06:17.570
This is a hash that is generated randomly by darker to know which containers which.

06:17.620 --> 06:18.450
Very cool.

06:18.610 --> 06:24.710
But if we did actually install node then we should be able to have the note command right.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.410
So fibrin no dash V from our container.

06:28.990 --> 06:33.950
Look at that we have the node version but I see I got six point fourteen point one.

06:34.510 --> 06:42.170
That's not what we expected because if we look over here we installed carbon and that should be a point

06:42.170 --> 06:42.500
in love.

06:42.520 --> 06:47.320
But instead we got six point fourteen which is boron.

06:47.410 --> 06:48.080
Interesting.

06:48.100 --> 06:52.620
Let's change the version number to the actual number.

06:52.630 --> 06:58.280
So in our case Leisure's say that we one version eight point eleven an endpoint.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.400
Let's see what we had here.

06:59.410 --> 07:02.190
Point one want to save this.

07:02.370 --> 07:09.330
And I'm going to exit out if you're just typing exit and rerun our commands again to remember the first

07:09.330 --> 07:12.780
thing we do is we want to build and let's see what happens here.

07:16.740 --> 07:17.190
All right.

07:17.190 --> 07:18.730
It's building everything.

07:19.170 --> 07:22.650
And now if we run our other command which is Daka run

07:25.670 --> 07:28.510
and let's see node version.

07:28.940 --> 07:32.080
All right we have our node version correct.

07:33.090 --> 07:37.890
You always want to check this to make sure whatever you installed is correct because sometimes you can

07:37.890 --> 07:41.460
make mistakes and think you have a CRN version but you don't.

07:41.460 --> 07:48.000
So you always want to check your containers to make sure that whatever you have set up is actually on

07:48.000 --> 07:48.660
there.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.670
But as you can see everything is running smoothly.

07:51.690 --> 07:56.820
We have a machine a container with node preset or for us.

07:57.070 --> 07:59.670
And how simple is that.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.090
By the way just for fun let me exit out of this again.

08:03.610 --> 08:07.750
I want to clear and let's run this command

08:10.260 --> 08:19.360
without the dash I-T parameters and you see that we can go into the container and that is because the

08:20.080 --> 08:29.830
command gives us what we call a TDY environment or it allows us to enter this dock or container.

08:29.890 --> 08:34.380
Now that we've gotten a little bit used to docker we have a few more things to learn so I'll see you

08:34.390 --> 08:35.670
in the next video.

08:35.870 --> 08:36.120
Buh-Bye.
