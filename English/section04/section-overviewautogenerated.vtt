00:01.480 --> 00:07.260
Welcome back Web sites have become more and more complicated.

00:08.230 --> 00:12.180
They're no longer just links and ASTM pages.

00:12.520 --> 00:13.990
You can interact with them.

00:14.230 --> 00:20.380
You can play games can have amazing interactions as we know.

00:20.570 --> 00:23.930
This is all powered by javascript.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.110
What does this mean.

00:25.120 --> 00:29.230
It means that our javascript files have grown significantly over time.

00:30.460 --> 00:39.350
With bigger javascript files we had bigger problems maintainability readability bug detection.

00:39.400 --> 00:46.480
So how do we manage this with bigger Tepes and more important applications.

00:46.480 --> 00:53.380
Think of Amazon for example they need a system that works and doesn't create bugs.

00:54.060 --> 01:02.010
They have thousands of developers massive code base well frameworks and libraries solve these problems

01:02.010 --> 01:12.030
for us and problems for Amazon tools like react in redox which our libraries allow us to fix many things

01:12.030 --> 01:19.350
such as writing code that is more maintainable writing code that is more readable and writing code that

01:19.350 --> 01:22.300
creates less bugs.

01:22.400 --> 01:28.800
And in this section we're going to start off with an optional reac section in case you are familiar

01:28.800 --> 01:29.510
with it.

01:29.940 --> 01:36.700
I'll show you how to build the robot friends up and from there we're going to go into the exciting topic

01:36.700 --> 01:43.040
of redox which I really really like and why it's such a useful tool.

01:44.380 --> 01:50.710
And then finally we're going to talk a little bit about what pack and bundling which makes developers

01:50.710 --> 01:52.380
Life's easier.

01:52.390 --> 01:57.620
Well finish off by giving our work to Brunow so that he's even more impressed with us now.

01:58.710 --> 02:03.810
By the end of this section you're going to feel very comfortable with something called State Management

02:04.290 --> 02:08.130
what it is and what it does and how to implement it.

02:09.540 --> 02:15.430
I know I keep saying this and I may be biased but is going to be a lot of fun.

02:15.600 --> 02:19.960
So let's get started and I'll see you in the next video.

02:19.990 --> 02:20.210
Play.
