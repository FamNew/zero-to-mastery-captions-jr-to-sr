WEBVTT

00:00.760 --> 00:01.530
Welcome back.

00:01.840 --> 00:08.700
Let's start to add this new feature that is to create multiple face detections.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.350
Now how should we start about this.

00:11.360 --> 00:15.320
The first thing I want to do is just move things around.

00:15.500 --> 00:20.310
Let's have our Front-End over here.

00:20.370 --> 00:23.230
So I'm not constantly going back and forth here.

00:23.670 --> 00:32.400
And the very very first thing is while we're dependent on this API this clarify API so I can go into

00:32.400 --> 00:39.830
the documentation and see what kind of response we get where I can just maybe log out whatever the backend

00:39.840 --> 00:44.020
does when we hit detect and clarify sends us a response.

00:44.100 --> 00:44.970
So let's have a look.

00:46.700 --> 00:53.900
If I go to the back end to the image I see that the clarified response is here in the data.

00:53.900 --> 01:01.090
So let's just cancel the log this data and see what kind of information we get.

01:01.130 --> 01:09.200
I'll save and like I said there's probably an easier way of me just going to the documentation to see

01:09.410 --> 01:11.150
what the what they respond to.

01:11.150 --> 01:16.370
But I think this way is more general so I think it would be more beneficial to look at through here.

01:16.370 --> 01:17.800
So let's go back.

01:17.970 --> 01:22.830
It detect make sure that our assumption is correct and that we return something.

01:22.970 --> 01:23.420
All right.

01:23.430 --> 01:25.480
Looks like we get a response.

01:26.790 --> 01:33.330
Description OK we get an ID created at model input data.

01:33.330 --> 01:37.820
All right data might be something that we're interested in.

01:37.950 --> 01:42.160
So let's go into that let's go with actually before we even do that.

01:42.270 --> 01:48.720
Let's see since we're just returning this plane data let's see what the front end is doing with this

01:48.720 --> 01:49.580
information.

01:50.580 --> 01:59.740
So in the front end if we take a look at the where was it the calculate face location.

01:59.940 --> 02:02.430
We see that we receive some data here.

02:02.430 --> 02:03.620
I wonder if this might be.

02:03.660 --> 02:09.420
So let's go to calculate face location find it where we actually call this and yet we see that there

02:09.420 --> 02:15.130
is a response which comes from here where we make the image you are alcohol.

02:15.240 --> 02:19.440
All right so this I think might be the response from clarify.

02:19.710 --> 02:24.290
Let's see what the front end returns.

02:24.420 --> 02:27.270
I'm going to just within here say console dialogue

02:31.040 --> 02:42.400
and describe the response going to save and I have to sign in because we just refreshed so G-mail dot

02:44.460 --> 02:51.770
Hey seinen and let's copy and paste.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.620
I've got to get the image again.

02:58.010 --> 03:01.220
Copy and paste detect and open up the console.

03:04.620 --> 03:04.880
All right.

03:04.890 --> 03:10.700
So this is the response we get outputs with an ID.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.820
Let's see we get data input input data.

03:16.880 --> 03:23.800
There's a lot of things that we can probably go to their documentation and figure out what we need.

03:24.870 --> 03:27.910
Let's see if we get zero.

03:28.150 --> 03:28.370
OK.

03:28.380 --> 03:29.820
So this is a lot of information.

03:29.820 --> 03:32.500
Let's see how we actually use it on the front end.

03:33.030 --> 03:40.110
So on the front end if I go to display face box which is what we're using or calculate face location

03:40.110 --> 03:46.290
which is why we're using the data for I go up here and I see that I'm getting the data outputs dad our

03:46.310 --> 03:49.830
regions region ampho bounding box.

03:49.890 --> 03:51.300
So let's copy that

03:54.120 --> 03:58.010
or let's traverse that our Celso data outputs data regions.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.300
So let's go to data outputs

04:07.310 --> 04:18.560
so data outputs zero data regions and how interesting we have an array here of two but if we go back

04:18.560 --> 04:26.920
to the code it looks like regions we're just using one and we're getting the region info and the bounding

04:26.920 --> 04:29.880
box to calculate face location.

04:29.890 --> 04:40.150
So if I go here I see that OK this is the bounding box top row left column bottom row right column and

04:40.480 --> 04:42.530
on the second one.

04:42.570 --> 04:42.810
All right.

04:42.810 --> 04:43.800
We have the same thing.

04:43.810 --> 04:44.040
OK.

04:44.050 --> 04:51.810
That's interesting what if we just have a an image with just one person.

04:51.810 --> 04:55.240
Let's click that again.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.630
We always want to test our assumptions.

04:57.630 --> 05:06.270
So I'm going to copy this and that's an that's a u r l song a hit detect.

05:06.290 --> 05:08.920
All right we get a second response here.

05:08.930 --> 05:17.060
Again let's test that to our assumptions right so if I go all puts euro data regions there's only one

05:17.060 --> 05:20.260
region because there's only one face.

05:20.270 --> 05:20.690
All right.

05:20.780 --> 05:29.430
So without coding anything we can assume that maybe regions might be what gives us the face information.

05:29.460 --> 05:35.280
Again this is without even looking at the documents or the API referenced by clarify.

05:35.380 --> 05:36.370
Let's test that.

05:36.910 --> 05:44.940
Let's have perhaps a loop instead of just returning one thing.

05:44.950 --> 05:46.270
Or even better.

05:46.300 --> 05:49.540
Let's change this data region 1.

05:49.600 --> 05:54.220
Let's see if here and if I go back I've got to sign in again.

05:57.460 --> 06:01.840
Sign in and use the image that we had over here.

06:01.840 --> 06:02.890
Remember last time

06:05.930 --> 06:09.740
we got this face detected but not this one.

06:09.740 --> 06:15.680
So again going back to where we changed that one line we said that we want the second phase detection

06:17.310 --> 06:24.650
all look of that his face is now detected and not hers just by changing that number in the array.

06:24.890 --> 06:29.710
So right away before we run any line of code we know where we can fix it.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.770
But just testing it out.

06:31.860 --> 06:40.840
So it looks like we need to loop over this and instead of returning an object perhaps we can return

06:40.840 --> 06:51.450
an array of objects and when we display the face or remember we have the display face box.

06:51.650 --> 07:01.270
We should return perhaps multiple objects of where the faces might be let's start to do that now what

07:01.270 --> 07:05.080
usually you want to do is create a new branch as you start to work on your feature.

07:05.080 --> 07:11.560
Now they have a big idea of where you want to start testing your code and your start your branch and

07:11.560 --> 07:15.490
start working on it and make small gradual commits.

07:15.490 --> 07:22.890
But for now I'm just going to skip that process because we want to focus on just creating this new feature.

07:22.960 --> 07:33.200
So the first thing we want to do is let's map over this instead of having the first survey item because

07:33.200 --> 07:42.250
I know this is a array now I'm going to say map and I know that it's going to return some face detection

07:42.250 --> 07:44.800
information on a safe face.

07:44.860 --> 07:47.510
And let's start a new line here so we can see it better.

07:49.350 --> 07:52.120
Close the brackets.

07:53.170 --> 07:59.350
All right and we have this information from each one of the faces so if I have two faces I'll have two

07:59.350 --> 08:00.610
items in the array.

08:02.550 --> 08:02.790
OK.

08:02.800 --> 08:11.110
So we have this now because we're looping over this and we want to return an object each time we can

08:11.140 --> 08:14.170
actually just move all this inside over here.

08:17.960 --> 08:24.530
And the face region info boning box is now what this expects.

08:24.560 --> 08:31.370
Let's assign a variable to this that is the clarify face that we're using here to measure where we should

08:31.370 --> 08:35.520
display that blue box where the faces are songlines say caused.

08:35.810 --> 08:38.570
Clarify face

08:42.950 --> 08:49.910
to face equals this and change the above variable.

08:49.910 --> 08:58.770
To clarify face's But actually I see that since we want to return these clarify faces which is going

08:58.770 --> 09:02.130
to be an array of these objects.

09:02.310 --> 09:06.430
I might as well just take this out and say return.

09:06.540 --> 09:17.050
So this calculate face location we might want to name it to collate faces or face locations and change

09:17.050 --> 09:18.520
this everywhere else that we see it.

09:18.520 --> 09:22.980
So let's say where else do we have this.

09:23.020 --> 09:26.730
So just these two places I'm going to change this to face locations.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.860
Want to save now.

09:31.990 --> 09:35.170
The next part is the display Facebook so we've.

09:35.290 --> 09:38.620
We're returning an array now of these objects.

09:38.770 --> 09:46.450
If we go to display face box that is a really funny variable name whereas it display face box we see

09:46.450 --> 09:47.410
that we're setting.

09:47.410 --> 09:51.970
So we're separating the box to equal box.

09:51.990 --> 09:57.790
All right but this is expecting an object and we're returning an array now.

09:59.270 --> 10:00.740
So let's change that.

10:00.740 --> 10:02.390
We have boxes now.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.610
And this should be boxes.

10:05.750 --> 10:14.720
And just to keep the names standard we should change our state name to boxes and Ophir where we have

10:14.720 --> 10:18.650
initial state changes to boxes again.

10:18.830 --> 10:21.950
We're now returning an array instead of an object.

10:21.950 --> 10:25.590
So let's change this into an array.

10:26.620 --> 10:28.680
All right let me save see if we get any errors.

10:28.680 --> 10:29.680
Nothing yet.

10:30.600 --> 10:33.390
Where are we using these boxes.

10:33.390 --> 10:35.730
We want to make sure that these names are apt to do as well.

10:35.730 --> 10:39.190
So let's go look for any mention of boxes in here.

10:39.210 --> 10:44.050
We have the bounding box which is from clarify that's fine display face.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.170
Perhaps we can change the name to boxes.

10:47.610 --> 10:57.440
Let me close that display face boxes and use it over here and update that as well.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.090
Where else do we mention the word box.

11:00.090 --> 11:07.160
We've seen the render we have this state box but again we have multiple boxes Nasaw going to say boxes

11:07.850 --> 11:11.220
and let's save just to make sure that we're not making any errors.

11:11.330 --> 11:14.360
And we see that line 1:38 box is not defined.

11:14.360 --> 11:22.510
If I go to 1:38 I see that face recognition component that received this box information now needs to

11:22.510 --> 11:27.450
actually receive boxes and perhaps we should rename it.

11:27.640 --> 11:30.270
Props to boxes as well.

11:30.370 --> 11:31.280
So let's save.

11:31.360 --> 11:36.520
Everything is working but we know right away that since we're passing boxes as props to face recognition

11:36.940 --> 11:38.810
we have to go into this component.

11:39.080 --> 11:43.060
You see I'm taking a step by step seeing where these variables lead me.

11:43.390 --> 11:51.320
I go to the face recognition and OK right away I see I should change just two boxes.

11:52.200 --> 12:04.680
And I also want to change this two boxes boxes boxes and boxes.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.810
Well let's save and see what happens here.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.240
It's always good to check our work and see where we are.

12:09.330 --> 12:13.910
So I'm going to say hey at gmail dot com.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.680
Hey let's seinen.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.870
And again use our favorite couple image

12:23.230 --> 12:25.820
to paste.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.560
Scroll down.

12:29.040 --> 12:29.910
Nothing's display.

12:29.910 --> 12:31.790
Now we just broke the app.

12:31.980 --> 12:33.840
But let's go back here.

12:33.870 --> 12:42.440
Let's see if we're getting any errors in the Network tab someone to again click and we make this a little

12:42.440 --> 12:43.010
bit bigger.

12:43.010 --> 12:44.900
We see that everything is working.

12:45.080 --> 12:48.320
So we might be doing something off here.

12:48.970 --> 12:55.900
And another tool that I like to use is perhaps the developer tools the re-act developer tools which

12:55.900 --> 13:03.520
again is a chrome plug in that you can install and if by let's say look for the face recognition component

13:04.480 --> 13:13.480
I see that this face recognition component has to has the bounding box over here that there's nothing

13:13.480 --> 13:15.370
in there that makes sense.

13:15.370 --> 13:22.400
But if we go into the over here and look at the boxes we see that right.

13:22.490 --> 13:25.150
It receives a props of tear rays

13:28.640 --> 13:31.440
Well those fund my stores got full while recording.

13:31.500 --> 13:32.670
But I'm back at it.

13:32.790 --> 13:39.840
All right so we have the array right now that has two boxes and it looks like it's returning.

13:39.840 --> 13:41.020
What we want.

13:41.010 --> 13:50.070
So let's go back to our app and notice here that OK so we're turning an array here that has an index

13:50.070 --> 13:57.230
of 0 and 1 but in the bounding box we're doing boxes that top row boxes right column which don't exist

13:57.270 --> 14:00.230
because this isn't an object anymore it's an array.

14:00.310 --> 14:06.300
Right so there's a nice little fix that we can do here again and we can just create a javascript expression

14:06.510 --> 14:09.040
by wrapping it in curly brackets.

14:09.290 --> 14:10.620
No that's not what we want to do.

14:10.620 --> 14:11.750
Curly brackets.

14:11.880 --> 14:17.040
And because boxes is now an array I can just say boxes.

14:17.100 --> 14:28.270
Map our favor function mapping that on each iteration has a box that if you remember gives us those

14:28.270 --> 14:37.490
properties the div with box's top row or box top row and other dimensions that we need.

14:37.510 --> 14:43.800
So let's just return this and I'm going to keep this on one line even though it's kind of long.

14:43.930 --> 14:48.690
So that way we can just say return and then the element that we want.

14:48.700 --> 14:57.070
And because this is now box we can just go back to using Box which has these properties of bottom row

14:57.400 --> 15:01.380
right column left column and let's safe here.

15:03.380 --> 15:03.750
OK.

15:03.910 --> 15:04.890
Let's go to a chart here.

15:04.900 --> 15:09.700
And again we're just going step by step just logically talking to ourselves and figuring out what we

15:09.700 --> 15:10.330
need to do.

15:10.450 --> 15:11.920
Let's go back.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.540
We have to sign in again.

15:15.280 --> 15:15.740
Let's go.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.680
Hey quick sign in.

15:18.860 --> 15:21.030
And I'm going to close this for now.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.080
Let's grab the image again.

15:25.340 --> 15:26.250
Go back here.

15:26.270 --> 15:29.270
Paste it.

15:29.320 --> 15:30.930
Look at that two images.

15:30.940 --> 15:35.060
Let's make sure that we don't get any errors to go to the console.

15:35.080 --> 15:35.650
Oh.

15:35.710 --> 15:42.520
Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique key prop and this is a very common warning and

15:42.550 --> 15:43.080
react.

15:43.090 --> 15:44.710
And that's an easy one to fix.

15:44.710 --> 15:51.370
Anytime you're mapping over aliments and re-act you want to add a key prop that is unique.

15:51.520 --> 16:00.190
The key for now is just going to be the box dot top row probably could be something better but at least

16:00.190 --> 16:01.540
we know that it's going to be unique.

16:01.540 --> 16:06.990
For now let's go back again because we have to constantly sign in.

16:07.030 --> 16:11.250
We might want to just change the route the state over the road for development.

16:11.260 --> 16:21.540
So we don't have to do this over and over but if we go back detect two faces Nowhere's if we go to the

16:21.540 --> 16:25.700
network it looks like everything is working perfect.

16:25.710 --> 16:31.350
I think we've implemented the feature and now what we want to do is actually test different things and

16:31.620 --> 16:34.490
try to break this and see if we get any errors.

16:34.530 --> 16:38.540
Perhaps maybe write some tests for this make snapshot testing

16:50.380 --> 16:51.700
and there we go.

16:51.700 --> 16:57.640
We have ourselves a new feature implemented make sure we create a new branch make a pull request you

16:57.660 --> 17:02.080
know test start different things try and break this that this feature is actually working we haven't

17:02.080 --> 17:06.130
made any mistakes and we got our first feature in the summer.

17:06.140 --> 17:11.260
