We have already covered two whole sections on performance and discourse as you can see it is a big topic

00:09.420 --> 00:12.520
with a lot of things that can be done.

00:12.540 --> 00:17.900
We learned about network optimizations and Front-End optimizations.

00:18.330 --> 00:23.450
But in this part we're going to learn about the last missing piece.

00:23.450 --> 00:28.650
What can we do on the backend to optimize our performance.

00:28.650 --> 00:35.640
We're going to talk about CDN as a topic we have briefly mentioned before and this course we're going

00:35.640 --> 00:40.260
to talk about caching database scaling Jesus.

00:40.650 --> 00:48.660
And finally load balancing an exciting topic where we get to do a bit of low testing for fun.

00:48.660 --> 00:52.700
We have a lot to cover so let's get started.

00:52.740 --> 00:53.670
I'll see in the next video.
