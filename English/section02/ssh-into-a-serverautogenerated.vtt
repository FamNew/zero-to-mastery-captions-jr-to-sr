00:00.800 --> 00:02.420
Welcome back.

00:02.420 --> 00:02.690
All right.

00:02.690 --> 00:09.020
Up until this point we learned that Diffie Helman key exchange provides for us a way to share a shared

00:09.530 --> 00:10.510
secret.

00:10.510 --> 00:11.830
I said share a lot there.

00:11.950 --> 00:16.650
Oh well now we still need to authenticate.

00:16.700 --> 00:23.830
So right now I could technically enter the password that was given to me by Digital Ocean and they won't

00:23.840 --> 00:24.880
show up over here.

00:24.890 --> 00:28.610
But let's try that again.

00:31.060 --> 00:31.720
Password.

00:31.720 --> 00:32.930
Copy and paste.

00:35.450 --> 00:39.950
And I'll keep the password the same.

00:40.040 --> 00:45.140
I'll have to change your password because they just gave me a temporary one so let's just keep it nice

00:45.140 --> 00:45.880
and simple.

00:48.450 --> 00:50.020
Oh boy they're asking a lot.

00:54.440 --> 00:55.130
All right.

00:55.130 --> 00:59.150
Finally were able to log in with our new password.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.570
But as I said before that is a bit of a hassle.

01:02.570 --> 01:04.890
You don't want to do that every time.

01:05.180 --> 01:13.430
So using S-sh we're going to use something called RSA which allows us to provide or prove the identity

01:14.540 --> 01:17.180
of the person without a password.

01:17.180 --> 01:18.840
Sounds like magic doesn't it.

01:19.130 --> 01:22.590
Let's get that set up and show you how we can do that.

01:23.620 --> 01:26.310
So I'm going to exit out of here.

01:26.680 --> 01:34.720
Let's clear this for now and I'm going to go into a folder that should exist on your computer if not

01:34.990 --> 01:37.930
you may have to create this folder.

01:37.930 --> 01:46.270
And the dot in front of it means that it's a hidden file so you may have to allow hidden files to even

01:46.690 --> 01:47.700
be able to see it.

01:47.950 --> 01:56.050
But if I just open this you'll see that is just a folder or like anywhere else on my computer my root

01:56.050 --> 01:57.160
directory.

01:57.490 --> 02:05.530
And if I look at the files in it I have a few things that you may not have because well this might be

02:05.530 --> 02:07.930
your first time generating a necessary key.

02:07.990 --> 02:11.650
In my case I already have some keys so there's some folders in there.

02:11.650 --> 02:13.450
Don't worry if you don't see them.

02:13.720 --> 02:17.370
Now if you see an I.D. or a safe file.

02:17.560 --> 02:20.590
If not you'll have to generate one.

02:20.680 --> 02:25.480
So let's generate a key just like we talked about in previous videos.

02:25.600 --> 02:31.700
We're going to generate a public and private key just for Digital Ocean.

02:31.840 --> 02:37.510
So that way with this computer with this laptop I can communicate with the server out there in the world

02:38.670 --> 02:39.930
the way we can do that.

02:40.140 --> 02:48.830
It's quite simple actually we can use the S-sh keys command which you should have on your computer if

02:48.830 --> 02:56.830
not you may have to install the CLID where you can get it a few parameters.

02:56.870 --> 03:02.480
There's a few that are recommended online but for now just to keep things simple we can just do

03:05.360 --> 03:09.250
this with whatever your email addresses solve.

03:09.380 --> 03:15.510
In my case I'm just going to do a test at gmail dot com wants to press enter.

03:15.810 --> 03:22.560
You'll get to ask where you want to save the file and you see over here that it's saving get in my data

03:22.620 --> 03:23.940
S-sh folder.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.480
But I also don't want to.

03:25.890 --> 03:30.900
I already have an ID or a say and I want specifically for Digital Ocean.

03:31.110 --> 03:39.210
So I'm going to go ahead and just copy this and name it Digital Ocean.

03:39.810 --> 03:46.590
So I know what the key is for going to press center and you have an option over here to enter a passphrase

03:46.590 --> 03:48.700
just for extra security if you want.

03:48.720 --> 03:54.530
In my case I don't really want to say you can just press enter enter and there you go.

03:54.560 --> 03:59.980
We've just generated a public and private RSA keep.

04:01.060 --> 04:02.200
Very cool.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.240
And now let's clear this.

04:04.420 --> 04:14.970
If I look at my folder I have the I.D. RSA Digital Ocean and Id say Digital Ocean and pop.

04:15.130 --> 04:18.320
Now if this is your first time what S-sh.

04:18.580 --> 04:19.540
Remember this.

04:19.540 --> 04:26.230
If you remember anything from the section that is does pub which is a public key you can share that

04:26.230 --> 04:27.500
with anybody that you want.

04:28.380 --> 04:36.510
But this idea RSA Digital Ocean which is a private key never ever ever shared with anybody.

04:36.510 --> 04:40.140
This is something that only you should keep on your computer.

04:40.350 --> 04:42.200
Never ever share it otherwise.

04:42.220 --> 04:47.620
Well pretty much all your encryption will be will be useless right.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.410
So we were just able to generate our keys.

04:50.430 --> 04:52.420
That's kind of cool right.

04:52.420 --> 05:00.580
We can now copy this key and share it with our Digital Ocean server.

05:00.580 --> 05:06.220
Remember in the diagrams we want to share our public keys by running the command and we can find this

05:06.220 --> 05:07.570
online if you want.

05:07.600 --> 05:14.660
So don't don't worry too much about it about it if you want to read up on what this command does.

05:14.800 --> 05:22.390
It pretty much just copies whatever's inside though Id say disclosure in God PABX remember only the

05:22.390 --> 05:23.730
public key that we're sharing.

05:24.010 --> 05:27.150
So I'm going to press enter here and I've copied this to my clipboard.

05:29.570 --> 05:42.410
Now if I go into S-sh to my Digital Ocean server see that I'm connected over here by the way if you're

05:42.410 --> 05:49.750
wondering why I was able to log in this is because it's the same session actually exit the session it

05:49.800 --> 05:52.370
will last me for the password to get.

05:52.450 --> 05:58.350
For now we can do the same thing on this server.

05:58.420 --> 06:07.640
We can make a directory called Dot S-sh just like we have on our computer.

06:07.730 --> 06:09.140
And I can't spell.

06:09.170 --> 06:15.920
So make directory and looks like the S-sh file already exists.

06:15.920 --> 06:20.050
So let's just do Alice and you'll see over here that I can't see it.

06:20.120 --> 06:27.430
That is because it is a hidden file remember I'll have to do a dash a to show our hidden Fox which is

06:27.740 --> 06:29.570
S-sh over here.

06:29.570 --> 06:30.140
Very cool.

06:30.140 --> 06:34.120
Let me clear this.

06:34.320 --> 06:39.370
Now we go into our DOT S-sh file and I cannot type.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.610
Let's try that again.

06:42.380 --> 06:42.680
All right.

06:42.680 --> 06:52.290
We're here in our S-sh And if we look over here we have already just by default from Digital Ocean known

06:52.290 --> 06:55.310
hosts and authorized keys.

06:55.380 --> 07:01.120
If you don't see this based on whatever server you have you can just create the file.

07:01.530 --> 07:04.550
But for now authorized keys is what we want.

07:04.620 --> 07:14.990
So we can use something like nano which allows us to add a tax inside of authorized keys now in here

07:15.000 --> 07:20.580
all we have to do is copy and paste our key that we had copied previously.

07:20.580 --> 07:27.810
So this is our public key from our desktop that we just pasted in here with Neno you can see over here

07:27.810 --> 07:37.140
to X it you have to hit command X or control X and then we want to modify and save We'll press Y and

07:37.140 --> 07:39.900
then press enter.

07:39.910 --> 07:42.580
All right so now if I do.

07:42.580 --> 07:51.130
LS I see that I have authorized keys and in it we have our public infight exit.

07:51.210 --> 07:55.300
Now well let's try this.

07:55.300 --> 08:05.750
I'm going to S-sh into my root folder or let's end the session to make sure that it doesn't ask us for

08:05.750 --> 08:12.950
a password and I'm going to see if I can enter it directly through S-sh with our keys without having

08:12.950 --> 08:15.600
to worry about passwords.

08:15.650 --> 08:21.110
So let's close this.

08:21.200 --> 08:30.310
All right so as I say each and you see here that we just got a permission denied and that's a little

08:30.310 --> 08:32.020
bit tricky here.

08:32.110 --> 08:40.930
You may have this only if you're like me and in your S-sh it's all in your S-sh folder you have multiple

08:41.320 --> 08:43.110
ID essays.

08:43.330 --> 08:50.750
So you want to make sure that it's using the right public key for this connection.

08:50.750 --> 08:58.100
So in our case we can just simply do this command which is as I say add and then grab the public key

08:58.240 --> 09:03.430
that we just used and sorry grab your private key which you've created.

09:04.480 --> 09:10.420
Press Enter Oh and you don't want to have your.

09:10.560 --> 09:12.610
You want this.

09:12.660 --> 09:14.350
All right so my identity was.

09:14.360 --> 09:16.350
So let's try S-sh ing again

09:25.170 --> 09:26.460
hand look at that.

09:26.830 --> 09:32.230
We have as insatiate into our box we've proven that this is us.

09:32.230 --> 09:38.410
This computer belongs to us and we have the authority to connect to the server and run any commands

09:38.950 --> 09:41.870
we want.

09:41.870 --> 09:46.340
All right Hosam we've done all of this and you're asking yourself.

09:46.460 --> 09:51.560
I feel like I just wasted a bunch of time learning this and it doesn't really relate to web development

09:51.590 --> 09:55.190
or how I can set up S-sh with get Hobb and that's easy to do.

09:55.190 --> 09:59.210
Andrea why are you bothering me with this.

09:59.230 --> 10:03.540
Don't worry we are going to tie everything together in the next video.

10:04.000 --> 10:13.500
So you see why all this hard work is going to payoff finally when we finish up with this section by

10:13.500 --> 10:16.660
the way just for fun just to see that this works.

10:16.650 --> 10:19.390
I'm going to let's clear this actually.

10:21.080 --> 10:34.290
I'm going to go into my essays folder and if I go into the authorization keys or authorized keys I'm

10:34.290 --> 10:40.790
going to delete this line I'm going to save it.

10:40.890 --> 10:45.900
And then finally I'm going to exit out of this close my terminal

10:49.170 --> 10:57.590
reopen the terminal over here let's clear this reopen the terminal over here and let's try S-sh.

10:57.620 --> 11:01.930
And to our server.

11:02.170 --> 11:02.980
Permission denied.

11:02.980 --> 11:05.550
But let's do this command that we did before.

11:06.600 --> 11:12.540
We've added the identity free S-sh.

11:12.920 --> 11:15.440
Permission is denied.

11:16.600 --> 11:21.770
Because we no longer have our keys.

11:22.840 --> 11:29.180
We no longer share the public key with the server and the authorized keys folder.

11:29.810 --> 11:35.120
Now we see that we cannot S-sh anymore by the way.

11:35.120 --> 11:40.630
Does the ocean doesn't actually expect every one of their user to be able to know how to do this.

11:41.690 --> 11:48.410
They actually have a really nice easy interface that you can use to add S-sh keys which actually works

11:48.410 --> 11:50.140
very similar with get help.

11:50.150 --> 11:52.550
So let's just copy our

11:55.030 --> 11:59.220
S-sh key again that we created for Digital Ocean.

11:59.500 --> 12:08.400
And if I go to Digital Ocean over here I can go to my profile settings

12:11.500 --> 12:16.010
and if we go to security you see that they have S-sh keys.

12:16.210 --> 12:23.300
I can add my S-sh key copy and paste and I'll just name it.

12:23.300 --> 12:32.930
Test had the S-sh key which does the exact same thing that we did from the terminal except well it looks

12:32.930 --> 12:33.330
nicer.

12:33.350 --> 12:38.820
How to you have a nice user interface here.

12:38.830 --> 12:39.270
All right.

12:39.340 --> 12:41.510
So there you have it.

12:41.650 --> 12:51.700
We're able to use all these tools symmetrical encryption asymmetrical encryption hashing in order to

12:51.790 --> 13:00.280
securely connect to a host and even be able to authenticate through S-sh.

13:00.320 --> 13:07.790
So with all of that knowledge in mind we're now going to look at our task at hand that Bruno asks us

13:07.790 --> 13:11.630
to do and that is set up S-sh with get help.

13:11.690 --> 13:13.160
I'll see in the next one Bebai.
