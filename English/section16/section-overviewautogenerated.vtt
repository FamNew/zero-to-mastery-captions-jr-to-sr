00:01.970 --> 00:09.110
As you start into your career as a developer you'll keep hearing continuous integration and continuous

00:09.260 --> 00:10.540
delivery.

00:10.550 --> 00:17.750
Those words if you work for any major software company they will talk to you about their processes their

00:17.750 --> 00:23.150
continuous integration their continuous delivery from day one.

00:23.170 --> 00:33.170
So what is this fancy speak you see working with code developers and teams is notoriously difficult

00:34.380 --> 00:42.120
as humans we are not perfect and making sure that a project stays on schedule with minimal bugs and

00:42.120 --> 00:48.180
without any major issues is a tall order especially when you have people with different coding styles

00:48.210 --> 00:51.900
dipping their hands in the codebase.

00:52.070 --> 00:58.010
In this section we're going to talk about a topic that is at the heart of almost all companies that

00:58.010 --> 01:01.620
want to deliver good software.

01:01.650 --> 01:07.740
You see senior developers understand this and they are put at the forefront to make sure that a good

01:07.740 --> 01:14.460
process is put into place such as continuous integration and continuous delivery and potentially even

01:14.460 --> 01:23.010
continuous deployment all topics we're going to cover in this section all big companies use these processes

01:23.250 --> 01:29.760
and as senior developers it is something that we should understand and know how they work how to implement

01:29.760 --> 01:35.970
it so that you can take a lead role on your projects and make sure that these projects are successful

01:36.660 --> 01:38.470
and we're going to learn all about that.

01:38.550 --> 01:42.300
And the section I'll see in the next video by.
