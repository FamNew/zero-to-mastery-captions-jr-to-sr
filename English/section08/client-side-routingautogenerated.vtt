I wanted to add a quick note on client side writing.

00:05.580 --> 00:07.860
I know I kind of brushed over the topic.

00:07.860 --> 00:09.870
But here's the general idea.

00:09.870 --> 00:16.920
Client side of routing happens when a route is handle internally by javascript that's loaded on the

00:16.920 --> 00:17.590
page.

00:17.940 --> 00:22.620
So that's something that we're going to see later on in the course when we work with our smart brain

00:22.620 --> 00:23.970
app.

00:24.240 --> 00:28.830
And that's how most client side render apps work.

00:28.830 --> 00:34.860
We're handling the routing with javascript because we're now using server side rendering like the old

00:34.860 --> 00:39.080
web pages that meet a request each time to the browser.

00:39.090 --> 00:46.260
Any time the rule changes the state of our application would also change.

00:46.260 --> 00:52.410
Now the main difference between client side rendering and server side rendering is that with client

00:52.410 --> 00:56.850
side rendering you don't have to refresh the entire page.

00:56.940 --> 01:01.640
Let's go back to our example if I just have the a tag.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.180
So let's comment this out.

01:04.450 --> 01:08.500
And I'm going to remove the comment from our e-tag.

01:08.580 --> 01:11.490
So this is now doing server side rendering.

01:11.610 --> 01:20.170
If I go back to my page I'm going to refresh and if I click the About page you'll see a flash.

01:20.200 --> 01:20.880
There you go.

01:21.070 --> 01:28.330
And you also see that all these requests were made to get the About page the entire web page or the

01:28.330 --> 01:30.690
entire page was reloaded.

01:32.320 --> 01:37.240
And if I go back again same thing that's server side rendering.

01:37.280 --> 01:40.090
Now if I use the link tag

01:43.160 --> 01:53.550
and let's comment this out again and I save here if I refresh the initial load downloads everything.

01:53.550 --> 02:03.120
But now if I click on About You see that only part of the page that is infected gets loaded.

02:03.120 --> 02:11.430
In our case is the about Dot js file and if we go back again because our indexed dot js file has already

02:11.430 --> 02:13.980
been loaded you won't see it anywhere here.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.130
And if I go about again again everything's already loaded.

02:17.280 --> 02:20.080
So we don't have to go back to the server again.

02:20.100 --> 02:23.590
That is something really really nice that comes with next access.
