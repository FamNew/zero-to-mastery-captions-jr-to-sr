Let's talk about strong and weak typing and a lot of people tend to use these terms interchangeably.

00:10.530 --> 00:17.250
That is they tend to say oh a dynamic languages weakly typed and a static languages strongly typed which

00:17.550 --> 00:21.930
simply isn't the case as you can see here on the graph.

00:21.960 --> 00:29.340
You can have a Greek language that is statically typed and a strong language that is dynamically typed.

00:29.380 --> 00:31.090
So let's make this clear.

00:31.420 --> 00:37.850
Javascript is a dynamic language or dynamically typed language that is weakly typed.

00:37.870 --> 00:38.950
What does that mean.

00:39.400 --> 00:43.550
Well in javascript I can do this in javascript.

00:43.550 --> 00:54.880
I can say variable A equals Booya and then I can go ahead and say plus 17

00:57.730 --> 01:01.340
Bruja with 17.

01:01.500 --> 01:06.810
That's what a weekly type language does.

01:07.170 --> 01:10.700
Javascript says Hmm you're crazy.

01:10.710 --> 01:15.460
You're trying to add a string to 17.

01:15.540 --> 01:17.150
I think I know what you're trying to do.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.590
I think you're just trying to add 17 to bruja.

01:20.610 --> 01:29.130
So I'm just going to turn this 17 number into a string and do this and this is often called type coarsen

01:29.420 --> 01:34.200
and Javascript and it can lead to some unintended consequences.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.410
And a lot of people get annoyed at javascript for this feature.

01:38.760 --> 01:47.430
Because in a strongly typed language you can do this for example in Python.

01:47.490 --> 01:51.320
You can see that it's dynamic but strongly typed.

01:51.480 --> 01:56.030
If we write some Python code let's say all do.

01:56.310 --> 01:58.440
And I'm just going to use Python here.

01:58.470 --> 01:59.760
Ignore the syntax.

01:59.940 --> 02:05.270
So let's say variable is equal to bruja.

02:05.270 --> 02:16.010
Again and then I'll do a or variable plus 17 here.

02:17.490 --> 02:23.660
Well this is actually going to throw an error in Python because it's going to say whoa whoa whoa whoa

02:24.360 --> 02:25.680
you crazy guy.

02:25.830 --> 02:28.190
This is you're trying to add string and numbers.

02:28.230 --> 02:29.640
That doesn't work.

02:29.700 --> 02:34.920
And it's kind of throw an error because it strongly typed.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.350
All right I hope that illustrates the point nicely for you.

02:38.400 --> 02:44.460
Now there are once again pros and cons to doing this but this is beyond the scope of this course.

02:44.480 --> 02:49.850
If you really want to get into it and trust me there's tons of information out there because people

02:49.850 --> 02:53.690
are so strongly opinionated about these topics.

02:53.810 --> 02:55.300
I do recommend checking them out.

02:55.340 --> 03:02.920
Going on Google and typing strong versus weakly typed Let's get back on track here to our main topic

03:03.130 --> 03:04.880
that is typescript.

03:05.080 --> 03:11.210
How can we add typescript to make javascript typesafe.

03:11.330 --> 03:14.210
All right I'm going to leave you in suspense.

03:14.970 --> 03:16.860
I'll see you in the next video.

03:16.880 --> 03:17.190
Babai.
