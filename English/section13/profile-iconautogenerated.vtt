WEBVTT

00:00.920 --> 00:02.210
Welcome back.

00:02.210 --> 00:09.670
I want to use a new library here now in our app right over here when we log in.

00:09.800 --> 00:15.560
Ideally I want to have perhaps a profile picture and then if I click on and have dropdown where I can

00:15.560 --> 00:25.370
say sign out or maybe profile and a profile pops up of the user and I want to use this re-act strap

00:25.640 --> 00:33.770
component library we can simply install it by using the re-act strap package and as long as we're using

00:33.770 --> 00:34.910
react.

00:34.910 --> 00:38.350
It allows us to use Boost Japp for components.

00:38.540 --> 00:45.590
And if you go to components you'll see that we can use a ton of things including the dropdown that I'm

00:45.590 --> 00:47.820
interested in looking at.

00:48.080 --> 00:53.700
That would be pretty nice to have on our profile and we see that it gives us a nice demo of what we

00:53.700 --> 01:00.270
can do and gives you pretty much copy and paste code which is really really nice.

01:00.950 --> 01:05.900
Now some of you might be asking why not just build this out ourselves.

01:06.880 --> 01:13.770
One is that well it's going to be a lot faster than building it out ourselves.

01:13.810 --> 01:21.430
And this is something that we can do fairly simply with some javascript and CSSA something that we've

01:21.430 --> 01:23.900
already covered before in my previous courses.

01:24.870 --> 01:31.170
But also when it comes to building fast and making sure that our app works we don't really want to worry

01:31.170 --> 01:34.810
too much about having a proper drop down functionality.

01:34.920 --> 01:43.360
We can just put in pieces into our app and then if we really want to remove libraries we can do so afterwards.

01:43.470 --> 01:50.190
But I also want to show you the dangers of adding third party libraries as you'll see when we add Riak

01:50.190 --> 01:50.910
strop.

01:50.970 --> 01:53.470
It's going to conflict with a library.

01:53.490 --> 02:01.200
We already have one that is called If we go back to our Front-End application and go into our source

02:01.500 --> 02:02.170
indexed.

02:02.310 --> 02:06.290
Yes we're using Tatiana's SPSS libraries.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.940
That has solved their app.

02:07.980 --> 02:13.470
Up until this point and I'm going to demonstrate for you why we want to be careful when we're just grabbing

02:13.950 --> 02:16.460
more and more libraries adding them onto our project.

02:16.590 --> 02:19.290
So I think it's going to be a good lesson for us as well.

02:19.290 --> 02:24.660
All right well we know that we want to install this package so let's just say NPM install and it's going

02:24.660 --> 02:29.830
to be called re-act strap.

02:29.840 --> 02:30.420
All right.

02:30.470 --> 02:31.190
Perfect.

02:31.190 --> 02:32.610
The next thing we want to do.

02:32.660 --> 02:41.750
Again going back to the Web site we also see here that we need to add bootstrap because the re-act strap

02:41.810 --> 02:47.060
package comes with the components but not with the styling that is bootstrap.

02:47.060 --> 02:52.230
So just to get the styling that they already have preset it looks like we can just NPM install boot

02:52.230 --> 02:53.010
strap.

02:53.060 --> 02:58.310
And if you're using a newer version of NPM you don't need to do dash dash save but just to show you

02:58.310 --> 02:59.200
that it's the same thing.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.560
I'm going to copy that.

03:00.860 --> 03:04.180
And then let's bring our front end up over here.

03:04.190 --> 03:08.100
So it's a little bit closer since we'll be working on that in this video.

03:08.420 --> 03:14.360
So we're installing bootstrap and then going back here we see that we need to import our CSA.

03:14.780 --> 03:20.390
And from there we can start importing whatever components that re-access shop needs.

03:21.820 --> 03:24.230
Now let's import the CSSA file.

03:24.430 --> 03:36.280
And if you see over here we now can go into our index page yes and import bootstrap with the M. fide

03:36.290 --> 03:38.160
see SS.

03:38.200 --> 03:45.430
Now here's the thing and here's how things work with create re-act up and they grab all the CSSA files

03:45.580 --> 03:48.430
that it finds and bundles them together.

03:48.880 --> 03:55.600
So right now the way we have things taxman's which already has some CSSA classes that we're going to

03:55.600 --> 04:03.580
be using if you go into dodgiest for example or actually let's go into a component let's say we're going

04:03.580 --> 04:12.270
to go into the face recognition we see over here that we're using these classes like empty to center

04:12.290 --> 04:18.040
Amay that are actual Tatian classes.

04:18.040 --> 04:24.760
Now because of the way create react up works these hearings are bundled and then the bootstrap cells

04:24.790 --> 04:29.080
are going to get bundled and whatever name clashes they might have.

04:29.080 --> 04:32.520
Let's say that both of them have a button class.

04:32.530 --> 04:37.220
Well the bootstrap one is going to overwrite it because it's going to be after Tatiana's.

04:37.590 --> 04:39.770
And we know that we like our app the way it is.

04:39.790 --> 04:46.420
So let's move this up here so that if there is anything that's being overwritten with DSS Tatiana's

04:46.960 --> 04:48.690
is going to win out.

04:48.760 --> 04:54.090
So let's say that we have bootstrap all loaded and ready to go.

04:54.100 --> 04:57.960
I think it's time for us to build our drop down functionality.

04:58.030 --> 05:01.870
So now that we have some components that we're going to be able to use.

05:02.170 --> 05:04.210
We also have Takiyama set up.

05:04.300 --> 05:11.260
The first thing I want to do is create perhaps an avatar or a profile little circle icon on the top

05:11.260 --> 05:17.230
right so that when we click on it it's going to have a drop down box that says View profile or sign

05:17.230 --> 05:19.520
out now.

05:19.960 --> 05:26.110
Luckily for us we're going to be using taxman's as well because they already have some pre-built CSSA

05:26.170 --> 05:27.260
for us.

05:27.260 --> 05:35.020
If I go back here I have tacked Kyon's And if we go to Avatar's we see that all right we have a couple

05:35.020 --> 05:37.750
of options that we can use.

05:37.880 --> 05:44.630
So say we want to use the circle border and look of that we already have the CSSA that we need for it.

05:44.660 --> 05:52.560
Let's go back to our app and have this circle appear if we log in here

05:56.180 --> 06:01.910
right over here and see that of the sign out and just so we don't have to keep signing in and out in

06:01.910 --> 06:03.490
and out in and out.

06:03.560 --> 06:07.210
Let's go back and go to our app.

06:07.360 --> 06:21.570
Yes and in our initial state make our route equal to home I save this and go back let's refresh Lupe's

06:22.850 --> 06:24.560
I have to do NPM start again.

06:25.710 --> 06:29.670
Well I have to go NPM start again because we did install some things

06:32.880 --> 06:34.760
yes sport 3000 and won

06:38.630 --> 06:41.110
and there we go.

06:41.210 --> 06:43.280
We're logged in now.

06:43.490 --> 06:47.750
We don't have a user you see that it's completely blank because we haven't logged in with anything.

06:47.750 --> 06:54.350
We all have that profile information but we also see that our stalling just got messed up quite a lot

06:54.350 --> 06:55.040
actually.

06:55.100 --> 06:58.690
We don't have that nice styling that we had before.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.090
What's happening here.

07:02.170 --> 07:05.290
Well again back to our discussion about CSSA.

07:05.410 --> 07:09.850
You see that index starts CSSA is right at the top here.

07:09.850 --> 07:17.800
And if you look at index Nazi SS our phone family was described in here and the bootstrap library we

07:17.800 --> 07:25.110
just installed and added to our Web site is overwriting our font family again.

07:25.200 --> 07:29.860
Do you want to do is ideally bring that CSSA all the way down.

07:29.920 --> 07:38.130
And also just keep CSSA together in a separate little section so that you know what's overwriting what.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.970
And again going back to just keep adding things over and over.

07:42.070 --> 07:45.270
This is a small enough app that we notice the changes right away.

07:45.340 --> 07:53.410
But as soon as you introduce a third party library and especially one that affects CSSA you might unintentionally

07:53.800 --> 07:58.000
change some of your webapp functionality as well as look.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.480
So you really want to be careful with this in a real project.

08:01.480 --> 08:07.210
I probably wouldn't be using these multiple libraries but I wanted to demonstrate that how dangerous

08:07.270 --> 08:11.110
it can be if I save this now and go back.

08:11.110 --> 08:12.080
All right.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.840
Everything is nice and smooth.

08:14.860 --> 08:20.950
We don't have the user yet because well we're kind of cheating and signing in but we have our set up

08:21.040 --> 08:21.710
all done.

08:21.820 --> 08:28.120
And ideally we want this profile like on that we saw an attack on us right here at the top and then

08:28.120 --> 08:31.950
if I click on it a dropdown menu shows up.

08:31.960 --> 08:37.450
So let's think about this the first thing we probably want to do is to build that profile icon that

08:37.540 --> 08:39.660
circular icon.

08:39.900 --> 08:48.670
And just to keep things clean let's create a new folder called at Profile and within this folder we'll

08:48.670 --> 08:50.080
create a new component.

08:50.290 --> 08:58.820
We'll say that this will be their profile icon component and we're here we can do our regular component

08:58.820 --> 09:00.710
and build that we do with react.

09:00.710 --> 09:07.010
We want to import re-act from their reata package.

09:07.030 --> 09:13.180
We also want to import some items from re-act bootstrap.

09:13.300 --> 09:19.240
But the doggo function let's not worry about it for now let's just work on getting that circular avatar

09:19.390 --> 09:20.370
on our page.

09:20.410 --> 09:34.980
We can just say class profile icon extends re-act dot component or I could just do something like this

09:34.980 --> 09:35.530
as well.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.460
But for now this is fine.

09:39.050 --> 09:44.230
And we want to export default the profile icon.

09:44.290 --> 09:44.980
All right.

09:45.010 --> 09:49.460
Now thinking about this icon this icon over here has the bit state right.

09:49.480 --> 09:59.150
It's either or clicked on and the toggle is open or it's closed and ideally I mean that's a simple true

09:59.150 --> 10:01.410
or false Boolean flag.

10:01.640 --> 10:08.620
We could move that all the way up to dog yes or include a redux store to contain that state but for

10:08.630 --> 10:16.500
small state that is really very specific to this profile icon and doesn't affect any other components.

10:16.520 --> 10:22.100
I like to keep the state in here because anybody that comes on to the project and needs to just something

10:22.100 --> 10:24.890
on the profile icon has everything in one place.

10:25.610 --> 10:39.570
So let's create our constructor method that will accept prop's and do our regular super call.

10:39.790 --> 10:50.170
And let's just say that this dot state is going to equal the let's call it drop down open and we'll

10:50.170 --> 10:52.290
set it to false to begin with.

10:55.080 --> 10:55.670
All right.

10:55.740 --> 11:01.060
And we also have our render function and within this render function what should we do.

11:01.290 --> 11:06.530
Well let's get our profile avatar from Tatiana's Well returned

11:12.570 --> 11:20.520
and let's say within here if we go back to taxations we can just copy and paste this little snippet

11:21.030 --> 11:24.770
pasted on here you got to fix this.

11:25.020 --> 11:30.350
And you see that the div is not highlighted and bread and that's because this is GSX.

11:30.360 --> 11:33.210
Remember we have to make sure that we close our tags.

11:33.300 --> 11:40.260
Even though this is valid to him all five without the closing slash and GSX we have to close our tags

11:40.890 --> 11:42.080
no matter what.

11:42.240 --> 11:42.450
Right.

11:42.450 --> 11:44.070
So let's say that.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.770
And if I go back.

11:45.900 --> 11:47.460
Well nothing's going to be shown.

11:47.460 --> 11:51.530
We have to actually import this in our homepage.

11:51.660 --> 11:55.200
Let's actually import this in our page.

11:55.530 --> 12:05.100
If we go back to our app we see that we have this area that we want to have to do and this area is where

12:05.100 --> 12:08.590
the sign and register component are.

12:08.650 --> 12:13.430
Luckily for us that's just right at the top over here and the navigation component.

12:13.450 --> 12:20.980
And because of a name it's fairly easy to see and we see over here that this is just adding the sign

12:20.980 --> 12:23.670
out sign in register components.

12:23.700 --> 12:39.050
Let's actually add this let's add the import whoops and port the profile icon from the profile capital

12:39.050 --> 12:46.420
profile and let's say profil.

12:46.510 --> 12:51.850
Now we have access to this component within the is signed in.

12:52.020 --> 12:59.430
Instead of having the sign out or for an hour we can keep the sign out just to have it there we'll add

12:59.460 --> 13:03.340
a profile icon.

13:03.570 --> 13:06.190
And right now it doesn't really do anything.

13:06.210 --> 13:08.460
So we're just going to pass it like that.

13:08.490 --> 13:11.770
Let's save looks like everything is fine.

13:11.780 --> 13:22.430
If I go back and refresh Let's see over here and you see that it's checking is signed in we're not checking

13:22.430 --> 13:25.850
the route we're checking to make sure that is signed in is true.

13:25.850 --> 13:35.530
So we have to go back to us make sure that is signed in is set to true so that our navigation bar also

13:35.530 --> 13:36.200
changes.

13:36.220 --> 13:37.260
Hey look at that.

13:37.420 --> 13:39.170
We have a nice little avatar here.

13:39.220 --> 13:41.470
All set up for us.

13:41.470 --> 13:43.270
Let's take a break in the next video.

13:43.270 --> 13:48.100
We're going to keep adding onto this functionality make it look a little bit pretty year and hopefully

13:48.110 --> 13:49.950
at our dropdown menu.

13:50.260 --> 13:51.480
I'll see you on that one.

13:51.590 --> 13:52.060
All right.
