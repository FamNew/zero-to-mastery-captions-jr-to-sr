00:01.340 --> 00:02.450
Welcome back.

00:02.480 --> 00:10.250
Let's talk about our next topic is B.S. everywhere and this is something that should be pretty familiar

00:10.250 --> 00:20.250
to most of the HTP us as we know is something called SSL and T.L. less certificates because a sheet

00:20.850 --> 00:24.760
without the s is a clear text protocol.

00:24.780 --> 00:32.190
It means that when we sent information from the client to the server it's in plain text.

00:32.190 --> 00:40.630
If anybody intercepts that message they can read it so SSL anti-alias creates a tunnel knownas a sheet

00:40.840 --> 00:50.210
B S S for secure and this encrypt the information between client and server.

00:50.270 --> 00:58.090
While we're making HDB requests for example if I was sending my username and password to check with

00:58.090 --> 01:01.230
the server to show that yeah I am who I say I am.

01:01.330 --> 01:03.060
Please let me log in.

01:03.070 --> 01:09.540
We're never ever ever going to use a GP if any web site ever does that.

01:09.630 --> 01:15.580
Runaway exit that website immediately because your password is going to be sent over the internet over

01:15.580 --> 01:19.500
the wires for anybody to intercept and see.

01:19.750 --> 01:28.780
And it's quite easy to do so you're going to see GDP ups in any web site that has any sort of form or

01:29.130 --> 01:33.480
any place where you need to enter sensitive user information.

01:34.830 --> 01:38.410
So how do we get these certificates.

01:38.700 --> 01:44.450
Because what they're saying at the end of the day is that you are who you say you are.

01:44.460 --> 01:52.020
This Web site lets encrypt is using a DP s because they've got an A certificate saying that yup this

01:52.020 --> 01:53.600
Web site is ours.

01:53.610 --> 01:59.450
We have the servers and we are who we say we are and we're not going to mess with your data.

01:59.580 --> 02:07.860
Well at least it's saying that they have the certificate and SSL until S uses some really high grade

02:07.860 --> 02:14.040
ciphers that make it virtually impossible for anybody else to see what the output of that data is that

02:14.040 --> 02:22.930
you're sending over the wire but there are ways that you can Miskin figure or set up your server where

02:23.020 --> 02:24.920
you think you have HTP TB.

02:25.150 --> 02:27.980
But it doesn't actually.

02:28.040 --> 02:32.770
So I'm going to show you my two favorite ways to get a CGP ass on your website.

02:34.790 --> 02:37.460
The best one is let's encrypt.

02:37.550 --> 02:46.100
You see encrypting communication is not only about privacy but also about user's safety since it will

02:46.100 --> 02:48.890
prevent most attempts at tampering.

02:48.890 --> 02:53.840
What they receive as well so yes.

02:53.990 --> 03:04.230
Which lets encrypt provides it gives you a certificate to have this as secure on your Web site means

03:04.230 --> 03:07.730
that you have this trust for both sides.

03:08.800 --> 03:15.430
Now in the early days you had to buy certificates from certificate authorities and you had spent hundreds

03:15.430 --> 03:18.210
of dollars and it was a really complex set up.

03:18.700 --> 03:25.780
And luckily for us for with let's encrypt They're much easier to set up and free of charge.

03:25.930 --> 03:32.500
You see a couple of years back the service launched to become a new certificate authority because all

03:32.500 --> 03:34.830
these other companies were charging so much for it.

03:34.840 --> 03:42.550
There are for profit and the issue these SSL TLM certificates by being part of the Linux Foundation

03:42.580 --> 03:45.480
and backed by some really big companies.

03:46.610 --> 03:52.010
Such as Google Facebook Cisco Mozilla the list just keeps going on and on.

03:52.010 --> 03:57.380
So you can't really trust them because as a certificate authority that issues these certificates you

03:57.380 --> 03:59.290
want to trust the party.

03:59.540 --> 04:05.430
Let's encrypt has great documentation on how to get a GPS set up for your website.

04:05.510 --> 04:10.550
Again if you ever have a form on your website you should be using a GPS and this is something that I

04:10.550 --> 04:15.320
feel like I keep mentioning in my courses because it is so important.

04:17.150 --> 04:22.310
Now another option that I really like and they have a free tier as well.

04:22.310 --> 04:27.590
And by the way if you're thinking about get help pages yes get help pages also allows you to have static

04:27.590 --> 04:34.960
sites that are search through a CPS but CloudFlare is really really good.

04:35.030 --> 04:41.690
They have a global network of servers that work has content delivery networks something that we're going

04:41.690 --> 04:48.600
to talk about in our third part in the performance section and by default they give you a sheet.

04:48.620 --> 04:49.210
Yes.

04:49.280 --> 04:54.440
So if you host your files with CloudFlare you're going to get us out of the box.

04:54.440 --> 05:01.280
They also have the added benefit that they help against something called the OS or distributed denial

05:01.280 --> 05:03.000
of service attack.

05:03.290 --> 05:09.490
And that is when a hand of computers try to send the request to a server at the same time.

05:09.770 --> 05:17.990
If we go back to our example imagine if we get a million machines or people at the same time to click

05:18.200 --> 05:24.670
send secret to the server the server won't be able to handle all this information.

05:24.680 --> 05:25.640
At the same time.

05:25.790 --> 05:26.950
And it could crash.

05:27.020 --> 05:33.350
And that's what a POS attack is and people use bÃƒÂ¡ networks to do exactly this.

05:33.380 --> 05:38.430
They can have devastating consequences because they take down your web site or your server.

05:38.480 --> 05:46.300
Luckily CloudFlare with all their global servers around the world has this basic Dio's protection out

05:46.310 --> 05:51.200
of the box and there are other tools in other places that offer this such as Amazon.

05:51.290 --> 05:56.020
But these are the two that I highly highly recommend.

05:56.060 --> 05:59.970
So if you've gotten anything from this it's pretty simple.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.580
Use UPS as a matter of fact.

06:02.630 --> 06:07.380
Google Now if you have a Web site with a form and you don't use HSDPA.

06:07.550 --> 06:10.880
They're going to have a bash here that says not secure.

06:12.110 --> 06:17.740
So again use they should CPS to make sure that your data is always encrypted.

06:18.590 --> 06:19.770
I'll see in the next one.

06:20.160 --> 06:20.450
But by.
