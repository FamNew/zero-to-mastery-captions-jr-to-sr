00:01.240 --> 00:08.170
Hello and welcome to the very first part of the course. We're going to be covering quite a lot of topics

00:08.170 --> 00:11.190
that span from Front-End to backend.

00:11.440 --> 00:17.920
But, by the end of this course, you should be comfortable using all these tools and technologies.

00:17.920 --> 00:21.450
Although these topics may seem quite different from one another,

00:21.700 --> 00:26.530
the course was designed in a way to have everything flow together.

00:27.240 --> 00:33.630
Although you can skip sections, I recommend you watch them in order because I show you how to connect

00:33.630 --> 00:41.580
the dots on all of these technologies, and what you can do to build the great professional software and

00:41.870 --> 00:46.420
the software that can compete with some of the biggest tech firms.

00:46.440 --> 00:53.100
So hold on tight because we're going for a ride. The very first topic we're going to cover, is the exciting

00:53.130 --> 01:01.990
topic of SSH. SSH or secure shell is a protocol.

01:02.210 --> 01:11.690
What does that mean? You may have heard of other protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP. These are all ways to

01:11.690 --> 01:17.620
connect to computers and have a shared agreement of how to communicate.

01:17.810 --> 01:26.630
That is their protocol or a language that they can speak and SSH is a way for machines to communicate

01:26.630 --> 01:29.160
with one another.

01:29.230 --> 01:38.530
For example, HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, allows you to send files over the internet like a HTML,

01:38.530 --> 01:48.250
CSS, and javascript files between browsers and servers. FTP or file transfer protocol allows you to send

01:48.250 --> 01:55.810
files as well and is often used when you upload files something like hostgator or a generic hosting

01:55.810 --> 02:05.490
platform from your computer. HTTPS is similar to HTTP but it is encrypted.

02:05.800 --> 02:10.740
That means third parties can't read the files being transferred

02:10.790 --> 02:19.560
if they intercept the messages. And there are many other protocols like IMAP that allow users to send

02:19.560 --> 02:28.560
e-mails and tons of others, and just like these, SSH is another protocol that allows us to communicate

02:28.740 --> 02:31.400
between two computers over the Internet.

02:32.400 --> 02:41.230
It allows users to share files as well as control and modify remote computers over the internet.

02:41.250 --> 02:43.550
Sounds pretty cool right.

02:43.550 --> 02:51.860
It was created as a secure way of communication which again encrypts all data so bad actors can't monitor

02:51.860 --> 02:58.540
you, and don't worry I'll go deeper into each one of these points later on in the videos.

02:58.580 --> 03:04.410
Now you might be thinking, OK, so what's the difference exactly from HTTPS?

03:04.970 --> 03:09.620
I mean, they're both a form of communication and they're both encrypted.

03:10.760 --> 03:18.230
Well just like a web browser uses the HTTPS protocol to talk with servers, and display Web sites.

03:18.230 --> 03:26.210
A shell needs a certain protocol to enable data exchange or communication between two devices and not

03:26.210 --> 03:29.510
just a browser and a server.

03:29.560 --> 03:34.820
And that's why SSH is called secure shell protocol.

03:34.890 --> 03:42.510
It's a protocol to use over shell and if you remember a shell unlike a browser allows you to talk to

03:42.510 --> 03:48.690
the operating system. Yes, you've used your command line before right?

03:50.030 --> 03:56.450
With SSH, I can use my terminal right over here which represents my computer.

03:57.280 --> 04:03.000
To talk to another computer. Let's say this was another computer somewhere in the world.

04:03.180 --> 04:07.760
Well, I can now communicate using SSH from my computer.

04:08.570 --> 04:13.940
To this computer over here through our terminal.

04:14.020 --> 04:21.280
Now the significant advantage offer by SSH over its predecessors is the use of encryption to ensure

04:21.280 --> 04:26.140
secure transfer of information between host and the client.

04:26.140 --> 04:33.300
The host refers to the remote server you're trying to access, while the client is the computer you're

04:33.310 --> 04:38.160
using to access the host.

04:38.270 --> 04:44.210
And as you can see that bad guy up there that looks very suspicious,

04:44.390 --> 04:47.480
he can't read our messages because of encryption.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.220
It's secure.

04:49.220 --> 04:53.030
Now in the next video I'm going to show you how to use SSH.

04:53.030 --> 04:58.620
And finally, talk about why this is useful for a web developer.

04:58.690 --> 05:02.530
Trust me it's going to be fun. See you in the next one. Buh-Bye.
