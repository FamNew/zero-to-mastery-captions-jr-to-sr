I wanted to add a quick note with this video and that is in Thai script there are several places where

00:07.850 --> 00:16.260
type inferences are used to provide type information where there is no explicit mention of a type.

00:16.370 --> 00:17.090
What do I mean.

00:17.090 --> 00:24.340
Well typescript is smart enough to know or infer and say yeah you mean a number or yeah.

00:24.350 --> 00:28.770
You mean a string and actually ADD types for you.

00:28.800 --> 00:41.540
Let me show you what I mean if I go let X it calls 2 3 or 4 and I save and let's just say I'm going

00:41.540 --> 00:48.110
to go X equals two.

00:48.460 --> 00:49.080
Hello Now

00:51.930 --> 00:52.900
well look at that.

00:53.070 --> 01:03.330
I get type hello is not assignable to type number even though I never said number here it inferred and

01:03.330 --> 01:03.810
said that.

01:03.810 --> 01:06.540
Oh yeah you're just giving me a number that's easy.

01:06.540 --> 01:08.180
X is supposed to be a number.

01:08.670 --> 01:12.760
And that's a really nice feature that you get out of the box without doing anything.

01:14.080 --> 01:18.790
So we have gone through all these features of typescript.

01:18.850 --> 01:20.170
Very cool.

01:20.170 --> 01:22.120
All right I'll see in the next video.

01:22.350 --> 01:22.540
Buh-Bye.
