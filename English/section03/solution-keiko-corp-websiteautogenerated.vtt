WEBVTT

00:01.240 --> 00:06.790
Welcome back let's see what I would have done which again doesn't mean it's right is just what I would

00:06.790 --> 00:10.140
have done to improve the performance of the website.

00:10.150 --> 00:12.350
Hopefully you had fun with this challenge.

00:12.400 --> 00:16.150
Hopefully there are some trick questions there that he had to kind of get through.

00:16.170 --> 00:19.270
But again I'm sure everybody did great.

00:19.360 --> 00:24.890
So we talked about minimizing Phylis minimizing delivery and critical render path.

00:24.940 --> 00:28.750
Those are the things that we focused on in this section.

00:28.750 --> 00:34.990
So looking at the KCl Corp Web site it's not too bad let's refresh you here just to get those animations

00:34.990 --> 00:35.490
in.

00:35.670 --> 00:36.540
Yeah.

00:36.670 --> 00:36.970
All right.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.700
I made the web site so I did cheat.

00:38.710 --> 00:43.570
I do know how we can improve the performance pretty well on this Web site because I made some things

00:43.570 --> 00:50.890
that were definitely not the prettiest but you can see here it's not a bad web site for being what it

00:50.890 --> 00:51.920
is.

00:52.030 --> 00:58.040
It has some animations some some nice scrolling that we can do.

00:58.820 --> 01:04.480
But you'll also notice here that they're using some libraries that don't even work.

01:04.850 --> 01:08.500
So let's take a look at the code and see what I would have done to improve it.

01:10.140 --> 01:18.010
The first thing I would do is definitely look at the female file and the female file over here.

01:18.150 --> 01:25.280
First thing that catches my eye is the massive amounts of stylesheets that we have.

01:25.300 --> 01:32.920
We see that they have a ton including bootstrap including transitions carrousel animate and obviously

01:32.920 --> 01:34.870
our main CSSA file.

01:34.900 --> 01:41.690
If I look at those swans I see that some of them aren't even minimized so we probably should minimise

01:41.710 --> 01:42.500
those.

01:42.640 --> 01:50.800
But my first question is really why do we need so many SS styles and do we really need them.

01:50.800 --> 01:57.640
Do we really need animate CSSA or can we do some of those animations with just CSSA animations and transitions

01:57.730 --> 01:59.770
that come natively.

01:59.810 --> 02:02.280
Again you really want to focus on.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.610
Do we really need this.

02:03.620 --> 02:09.810
Don't just keep tacking on different things just because it's easy to do.

02:09.960 --> 02:16.480
So again I would definitely definitely look into this and say I could probably get rid of some of this.

02:16.560 --> 02:19.670
Then I scroll down and I see some script accent.

02:19.700 --> 02:25.520
Oh boy there's a lot of script tags and they're all in the head which definitely we don't want to do.

02:25.530 --> 02:32.340
We want to move all of these down to the very end of the body unless they're super important but looking

02:32.340 --> 02:39.750
at these Jey query carrousel parallax scroll to a nice scroll while we can definitely put all those

02:39.750 --> 02:40.580
down there.

02:41.530 --> 02:45.470
We also want to ask ourself again do we really need this.

02:45.520 --> 02:48.500
For example scroll to what it does.

02:48.570 --> 02:53.890
It's supposed to make us scroll to the part of the website that we care about.

02:53.890 --> 02:56.300
But you can see that it's not even working.

02:56.380 --> 02:58.880
So maybe we don't even need that.

02:59.140 --> 03:06.490
Again looking at why you need and why you don't need I then think about maybe are these minimised if

03:06.490 --> 03:07.400
they're not minimized.

03:07.450 --> 03:10.650
OK this one is this one is but this one isn't.

03:10.660 --> 03:12.870
Perhaps we should minimize all that.

03:13.150 --> 03:19.480
And then finally combine all of these into one file maybe have one main bundle file and the rest are

03:19.780 --> 03:24.390
the vendor files all in one again minimizing our trips over the wire.

03:25.210 --> 03:33.920
And then scrolling down through here you know typical typical a shemale nothing too crazy everything

03:33.920 --> 03:36.160
looks pretty good here.

03:36.590 --> 03:42.050
But again let's review some of our points and see what we can improve on here.

03:42.050 --> 03:48.510
All right so we talked about loading style tags in the head loading scripts right before the body.

03:48.530 --> 03:49.040
All right.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.700
And then CSSA only loading whatever is needed.

03:51.710 --> 03:56.940
We definitely talked about that we didn't talk about above the fold loading.

03:57.070 --> 04:04.920
Again looking at the Web site we see that well we definitely have a nice scrolling Web site but we don't

04:04.920 --> 04:11.210
need these images or any of these down below especially the CSSA.

04:11.390 --> 04:12.640
We only need the top part.

04:12.890 --> 04:22.720
So perhaps one thing we can do is actually add a style tag Rupes sell tag on our site it's really hard

04:22.720 --> 04:26.570
to type when you have a mike and you're in your face like I do.

04:26.710 --> 04:33.310
And you know that's just a side note in case you want to know with this style tag I can have some styles

04:33.430 --> 04:39.070
just for the main part of the page that the viewer sees right away.

04:39.370 --> 04:46.930
And this way I can just load my style sheets like I showed you after the page loads and all the stuff

04:46.930 --> 04:49.580
below the fold loads afterwards.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.470
So that's one way.

04:51.470 --> 04:55.440
Another thing we can look at is the media attributes.

04:55.510 --> 05:02.520
Looking at this background image it looks pretty big and I bet it's not optimized for the mobo.

05:02.950 --> 05:07.150
So let's take a look at how big this image is I want to open up the airport.

05:07.510 --> 05:14.770
I can't talk I am going to open up the network tab with developer tools and then I'm going to filter

05:14.800 --> 05:19.240
for images and I'm going to refresh and boy.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.560
That's a lot of images.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.470
I think it's the hero image.

05:22.460 --> 05:23.440
Yeah there it is.

05:23.740 --> 05:29.190
So we see over here that this image is one megabyte.

05:29.210 --> 05:31.520
That's that's pretty ridiculous.

05:31.530 --> 05:37.590
We can definitely compress this and minimizes and we definitely don't need that big of an image for

05:37.590 --> 05:39.030
a mobile screen.

05:40.010 --> 05:44.580
Also let's take a look at all of the requests that were making on this page.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.010
Oh boy.

05:46.010 --> 05:47.920
That's 48 requests.

05:47.990 --> 05:50.440
We definitely don't need that many requests.

05:50.510 --> 05:56.180
By the way this is how a lot of older Web sites used to work and definitely not not the best I would

05:56.180 --> 05:58.300
say.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.760
All right let's see what else we can improve here.

06:03.160 --> 06:06.500
We talked about the first three but less specificity.

06:06.880 --> 06:11.800
And this Web site they're not too bad with this and this is one of those minor things that you don't

06:11.800 --> 06:14.640
really want to worry too much about.

06:14.680 --> 06:18.900
It does affect performance but not to the extent of some of the other things.

06:18.910 --> 06:22.960
So I wouldn't worry too much about this but I wanted to include it there anyway for you.

06:23.860 --> 06:29.260
We also talked about loading scripts but we didn't talk about asynchronously or deferring those scripts

06:29.530 --> 06:35.210
for javascript or for Jay query and all these other scripts that we didn't really need.

06:35.260 --> 06:40.280
We probably want to add an async or deferred tag to them if we want to keep them around.

06:41.280 --> 06:48.000
We also want to minimize DOM manipulation and avoid long running Javascript.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.470
So let's take a look here.

06:50.160 --> 06:55.950
DOM manipulation Well I think that's happening a lot especially with all these animations that we see

06:55.950 --> 06:57.510
again if we refresh.

06:57.510 --> 07:00.320
We see all the animations that happen here.

07:01.360 --> 07:08.160
We can definitely avoid some of this especially using Jake queery the fact that they're using J.A.G.

07:08.260 --> 07:09.360
right now.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.440
Let's take a look at some of the stuff that we do.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.990
The parallax to go to Maine.

07:14.050 --> 07:16.740
You see that they're using Jacquier a lot.

07:16.930 --> 07:19.450
And that library is great.

07:19.570 --> 07:24.820
However pretty much anything they can do in jail where you can do with native Java.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.800
I think there's a Web site called.

07:28.060 --> 07:31.380
You don't need a query.

07:31.690 --> 07:37.690
Let's see.

07:37.900 --> 07:44.650
Or you might not need Jacqui and actually shows you all the things you can do with javascript instead

07:44.650 --> 07:51.370
of using Jay Querrey so we can avoid using this massive library and just use javascript that comes with

07:51.370 --> 07:51.830
the.

07:53.160 --> 07:58.710
And again we're using tools like scroll to or libraries like scroll to.

07:58.710 --> 08:06.330
That is supposed to make our Web site clickable and scroll to that section but it's not even working.

08:06.330 --> 08:10.850
So again really testing out to see do we really need this.

08:10.950 --> 08:13.560
And then finally avoid long running Javascript.

08:13.560 --> 08:17.890
I don't think we have too much of that but with animations that can get pretty tricky.

08:18.180 --> 08:25.470
So again things that you can improve on and we're just scratching the surface here but I hope you really

08:25.470 --> 08:27.720
had fun with this exercise.

08:27.720 --> 08:34.190
It was definitely fun making this Web site and I'm really excited to see how fast some of these Web

08:34.190 --> 08:35.150
sites can get.

08:35.250 --> 08:38.080
As I watch you post them and to the community.

08:38.310 --> 08:44.650
But the key thing to remember here is that performance is a never ending game.

08:44.970 --> 08:47.350
You can always improve performance over Web site.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.520
You can always tweak that little thing.

08:49.830 --> 08:55.500
As a senior developer you want to make sure that you spend your time wisely on things that matter.

08:55.500 --> 09:03.030
Figure out what's valuable for your client for your business for your boss and do those performance

09:03.130 --> 09:07.920
optimizations but only to the point that is needed because otherwise you're going to drive yourself

09:07.950 --> 09:08.250
mad.

09:08.250 --> 09:09.810
There's so many things you can do.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.490
Focus on those big ticket items.

09:11.490 --> 09:15.460
The key features to make a web site performant.

09:15.710 --> 09:21.250
I hope you had fun in this challenge and I look forward to seeing you in the next video Popeye.
