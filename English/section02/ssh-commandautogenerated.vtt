00:01.830 --> 00:02.750
Welcome back.

00:02.970 --> 00:07.730
So I just talked a lot about SSH and it sounds pretty interesting.

00:07.740 --> 00:10.840
But how exactly do we use it?

00:11.070 --> 00:13.530
Well it's actually quite simple.

00:13.590 --> 00:22.950
We just run the SSH command with whatever user we want to reach at whichever host that is whichever

00:22.950 --> 00:27.270
computer IP address we want to get to.

00:27.270 --> 00:33.070
Let me show you what I mean by a little bit of a demonstration. Right over here

00:33.090 --> 00:41.940
I went to Digital Ocean dot com and Digital Ocean is a provider that gives us servers for really really

00:41.940 --> 00:44.330
cheap actually really really like them.

00:44.340 --> 00:49.920
And if you're ever testing out stuff and you're looking for a good option to have a server somewhere

00:49.920 --> 00:53.790
out in the cloud. Well Digital Ocean is great.

00:53.820 --> 00:59.550
I went ahead and actually created something called droplets and that's what they call their version

00:59.550 --> 01:02.000
of servers that you can purchase.

01:02.020 --> 01:09.540
I selected Ubuntu which for those who don't know, it is an open source operating system that's built

01:09.540 --> 01:10.760
on top of Linux.

01:10.890 --> 01:16.460
Most servers out there in the world use Ubuntu so it's it's the standard.

01:16.470 --> 01:21.470
I'm just going to get the cheapest option here for $5 a month just a little memory.

01:21.630 --> 01:27.360
CPU you we're not going to be using it for anything too crazy so this is great.

01:27.450 --> 01:29.790
I chose San Francisco as my region.

01:29.790 --> 01:33.190
Actually I'm going to choose New York because it's closer to me.

01:33.210 --> 01:35.670
So that's where the servers are going to be located.

01:35.850 --> 01:45.070
And I'm just going to hit create, and once I hit create it will just give me a server that I can access.

01:45.090 --> 01:51.720
So right here with a bit of a jibberish of a name that is my server, and you see over here how they give

01:51.720 --> 02:00.960
me the IP address of my server while I can just copy this and I just go to my terminal I can now, using

02:00.960 --> 02:11.640
the SSH command, access route which is the user that they give us by default and copy and paste the

02:11.700 --> 02:14.530
IP address that they gave us.

02:14.700 --> 02:18.180
Hit enter and look at that.

02:18.260 --> 02:22.120
I am now in sight of that server.

02:22.370 --> 02:26.400
Inside of that terminal and I can access anything I want.

02:26.450 --> 02:31.500
So if I click "ls" I see here that I've created a hello directory.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.260
I can also do another directory.

02:33.260 --> 02:41.350
Let's just run a make directory and we'll call it "woohooo" because we're very excited.

02:41.510 --> 02:46.670
So now if I go LS look at that I have a directory called Woohoo.

02:46.670 --> 02:50.400
And I have full access to the server.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.900
Very very cool.

02:51.980 --> 02:56.870
And don't worry I'm going to show you how to actually set this up and how I got everything working.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.930
And later on videos.

02:59.030 --> 03:02.310
But for now let's just go back to this slide.

03:03.280 --> 03:10.120
Now if you're using Linux or Mac then using SSH is very simple. If you use Windows,

03:10.160 --> 03:16.990
you'll need to utilize an SSH client to open a SSH connections, and the most popular one for Windows

03:16.990 --> 03:24.100
is called "putty" which I'll include in the resources for this lesson. Now by using SSH we can connect

03:24.100 --> 03:29.820
to this remote computer and run commands on it just like I showed you.

03:29.980 --> 03:37.090
Now how cool is that using SSH we can connect to any computer that allows for these SSH connections

03:37.990 --> 03:39.450
anywhere in the world.

03:39.520 --> 03:46.060
So let's review, the SSH key command and structure your system that you want to open an encrypted secure

03:46.060 --> 03:51.340
shell connection. User represents the account you want to access.

03:51.340 --> 03:58.630
For example you may want to access the root user which is basically synonymous for system administrator

03:58.930 --> 04:05.210
with complete rights to modify anything on the system which can be dangerous at times.

04:05.990 --> 04:09.370
Host refers to the computer you want to access.

04:09.440 --> 04:15.280
This can be an IP address like the one we used or a domain name.

04:15.510 --> 04:24.310
And once you hit enter, you're greeted with a remote terminal window just like we were in that example. OK.

04:24.630 --> 04:32.460
So you're thinking to yourself, cool Andrei, but how does this apply to web development?

04:32.950 --> 04:39.760
Well let me tell you a story and why I'm starting with this lesson in this course. On my very first day

04:39.850 --> 04:41.690
as a full time developer,

04:41.770 --> 04:45.960
I was asked to create an SSH key and connected to get help.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.640
And guess what.

04:47.770 --> 04:50.340
I had no idea how to do that.

04:50.410 --> 04:58.840
I knew all about HTML, CSS, javascript and all that stuff, but nobody told me anything about using SSH

04:58.840 --> 05:00.280
key for get home.

05:00.330 --> 05:01.580
What was that?

05:01.630 --> 05:04.570
You see I had no idea how to do it.

05:05.420 --> 05:11.420
SSH is a very important concept that not many talk about but as a web developer you really need to

05:11.420 --> 05:16.330
understand because, you will use SSH all the time in your career.

05:16.430 --> 05:24.660
So some of these examples include, connecting to GitHub, clone, push, pull files from their servers to

05:24.660 --> 05:27.510
your computer.

05:27.620 --> 05:33.900
Remember how when we clone something from a GitHub we have two options we have use HTTPS which you've

05:33.920 --> 05:43.450
most likely used before, and use SSH and remember how with HTTPS you had to enter your password all

05:43.450 --> 05:45.700
the time to clone a repo?

05:46.060 --> 05:48.250
You don't have to do that with SSH.

05:48.550 --> 05:52.590
And there's a few other benefits that will go over later.

05:52.620 --> 05:56.760
Second, you can remotely access another computer.

05:56.760 --> 06:02.200
So if you're at home when you need to access your computer work, you can just SSH into it.

06:03.770 --> 06:11.360
Finally probably the most important use case is you have your production app somewhere on a server, and

06:11.360 --> 06:17.510
in the middle of the night you get a call. Hey we deleted your app by mistake.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.700
Can you re-install it on the server?

06:20.950 --> 06:25.530
Now this sounds ridiculous but it's actually something that has happened to me.

06:25.660 --> 06:33.100
I had to SSH into the server get the project files to the server again and go through all the steps

06:33.370 --> 06:42.020
of running NPM install, NPM build, NPM start, to get the app back up and running.

06:42.030 --> 06:48.450
So with the rest of the videos I'm going to show you how to master SSH never have to experience what

06:48.510 --> 06:50.690
I did on my first day of the job.

06:50.700 --> 06:57.960
You'll learn how encryption works how to use SSH to solve the above problems, and also how to set up

06:57.960 --> 07:01.600
a server to allow for SSH connections.

07:01.650 --> 07:03.500
It is a skill that is so important.

07:03.570 --> 07:05.900
I wanted to be the first part of the course.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.860
It's going to be a lot of fun.

07:07.980 --> 07:10.390
So I'll see on the next video. Buh-Bye.
