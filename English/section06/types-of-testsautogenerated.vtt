Welcome back now tests in general can be grouped into three main categories.

00:10.200 --> 00:16.880
Now everybody has their own definition and sometimes somebodies definition might overlap with the other

00:16.880 --> 00:20.910
category but just as a mental framework.

00:21.290 --> 00:27.620
Think of tests as having three main distinct types.

00:27.670 --> 00:35.380
The first are unit tests and these are the most common the easiest to implement and the ones that are

00:35.380 --> 00:37.790
really important to have in your application.

00:39.240 --> 00:45.170
Unit tests as the name suggests tests individual functions or classes.

00:45.510 --> 00:53.070
So if I had a some function I'm going to just test that one function to make sure that it does what

00:53.070 --> 00:54.040
it says it does.

00:54.180 --> 01:01.290
Maybe if it accepts parameter A and B I want to make sure that A and B get added with that function.

01:02.270 --> 01:09.890
They are the cheapest to implement the easiest to implement and 90 percent of your time you're going

01:09.890 --> 01:12.350
to be working on writing unit tests.

01:12.350 --> 01:14.660
They're very very useful.

01:14.660 --> 01:19.180
The second one is something called integration tests.

01:19.370 --> 01:23.870
This is testing how different pieces of code work together.

01:24.170 --> 01:32.930
So it can be testing of whether the database works with the express app that's requesting some data

01:32.930 --> 01:40.820
from the database or it could be how a function works with another function and how this connection

01:40.820 --> 01:44.660
between them works and testing that.

01:44.680 --> 01:49.480
Finally we have automation tests or UI tests.

01:49.480 --> 01:56.050
This usually involves testing real life scenarios on the browser by controlling the browser and making

01:56.050 --> 02:00.460
sure that the expected behavior on the web is correct.

02:00.460 --> 02:07.450
Now you can have humans doing this where they go through and click through everything on your Web site

02:07.450 --> 02:08.780
and make sure everything works.

02:08.860 --> 02:16.330
Or you can programmatically have robots or code that you write that runs through these tests for you

02:17.440 --> 02:19.710
as we go down into this order.

02:19.720 --> 02:23.650
They become more and more expensive to implement.

02:23.650 --> 02:24.540
What does that mean.

02:24.760 --> 02:32.110
Well automation tests just by hearing about what they do are a lot more difficult to implement than

02:32.170 --> 02:32.980
unit tests.

02:33.010 --> 02:33.490
Right.

02:34.340 --> 02:39.710
So all these tests have their use cases but have their pros and cons as well.

02:41.250 --> 02:47.180
And we're going to talk about each one of these but for now let's leave it at that.

02:47.340 --> 02:52.140
And in the next video we're going to talk about some of the tools that you're going to encounter as

02:52.140 --> 02:54.590
you start to write tests.

02:54.680 --> 02:55.470
I'll see in the next one.
