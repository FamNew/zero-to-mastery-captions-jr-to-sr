WEBVTT

00:01.160 --> 00:02.180
Walk them back.

00:02.290 --> 00:08.320
Now that we have a nice profile icon and a nice drop down menu I want to make sure that these things

00:08.320 --> 00:08.840
work.

00:08.860 --> 00:14.650
So let's work out the sign out functionality and this video and also remove this over here because we

00:14.650 --> 00:16.720
don't really need this anymore.

00:16.720 --> 00:18.750
Let's get back to our tech center.

00:18.910 --> 00:26.200
The first thing we want is we want the on a road change function which we already use in our app in

00:26.200 --> 00:31.230
our sign out over here and let's change out to sign out perfect.

00:31.860 --> 00:39.550
And in here if you go back to our navigation we see that all these routes have the on route change prop

00:39.640 --> 00:43.980
that we receive from the app and that simply changes routing for us.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.450
Let's grab the on route change.

00:47.460 --> 00:49.090
Assume that we get that as props.

00:49.110 --> 01:01.030
We'll work on that in a bit and say that this Daut prop's or we have to actually have an enclave function

01:01.810 --> 01:10.390
and this unclick function is going to have the this dobbed props start on row change called with the

01:10.390 --> 01:17.270
sign out called because we want to sign up and we also need to actually pass this Propp now.

01:17.310 --> 01:23.970
So let's go back to our navigation and in here we can actually change this up.

01:23.970 --> 01:31.830
We can completely remove the text that said sign out because we don't need it anymore but we do want

01:31.830 --> 01:34.850
the on road change function to work here.

01:34.920 --> 01:42.060
So let's just pass down the on route change down to profile like on because we already have access to

01:42.060 --> 01:51.430
that and navigation and just completely erase the speed at let me save go back

01:59.030 --> 02:06.490
and we have a bit of an issue here and that is because if we go to our profile icon Well I can just

02:06.760 --> 02:08.770
call this inside of the function.

02:08.770 --> 02:12.240
I have two more inside of the on click.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.330
I have to actually

02:16.730 --> 02:24.110
assign the function so that when on click happens the function runs not just immediately running it.

02:24.110 --> 02:30.330
All right let's say that go back quick on this.

02:30.340 --> 02:30.620
Hurry.

02:30.620 --> 02:31.190
Perfect.

02:31.190 --> 02:35.860
If I click sign out look at that i'm signed out.

02:35.880 --> 02:36.640
That's awesome.

02:36.860 --> 02:39.630
Now there's a few things that I'm noticing here.

02:39.650 --> 02:44.260
One is that oh my dropdown menu is a little bit off here.

02:44.270 --> 02:45.950
We need to adjust some VSS.

02:45.980 --> 02:49.220
And also when I sign out I don't want to go to the register page.

02:49.250 --> 02:55.640
I want to go to the sign and page let's fix that first.

02:55.670 --> 03:02.570
What we want to do is if we go to app that J.S. We'll see if I can find it or if we go to dodginess

03:04.090 --> 03:09.260
and on road change if we scroll down we see that it's a very simple router.

03:09.430 --> 03:19.060
When we sign out we set state to initial state in which case that is our sign out or in our case it's

03:19.060 --> 03:24.980
the home which we're changing just for the devolvement purposes.

03:27.450 --> 03:29.250
And there's many ways to fix this.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.100
First of all this routing logic could be improved.

03:32.100 --> 03:37.980
We see that we actually have the same route sign out which says state to initial state and then because

03:37.980 --> 03:39.250
it keeps going.

03:39.330 --> 03:48.510
It also runs the route to set to whatever route we pass it to now in our case because we pass the sign

03:48.510 --> 03:55.900
out route and if we scroll down here we have the route sign in and that's where we're checking for.

03:55.920 --> 03:59.150
And in that case we get signed and otherwise we get register.

03:59.160 --> 04:05.600
Well the logic here is a little bit off but a quick fix that we might want to do here we can add actual

04:05.600 --> 04:11.790
logic here so maybe if it's sign if the rowdiest sign out we can just go to the sign and page as well

04:12.360 --> 04:17.940
or we can't simply just call return here so that we don't even update the route.

04:17.970 --> 04:25.050
We just as soon as we sign out get to the initial state which in our case will be the will be the sign

04:25.050 --> 04:25.600
in page.

04:25.620 --> 04:30.560
And this is never going to be called Let's save and just test this out.

04:32.100 --> 04:40.190
I'm going to change the route to what we had before which was sign and and all changes is signed into

04:40.190 --> 04:41.490
force as well.

04:41.660 --> 04:44.810
Going back I will do my.

04:44.810 --> 04:51.170
Hey put a dot com and notice that my styling career has changed again because of boot straps again something

04:51.170 --> 04:55.550
that will have to fix I'm signed in the file.

04:55.550 --> 04:58.800
Click here and sign out.

04:58.850 --> 04:59.500
Perfect.

04:59.510 --> 05:02.460
I'm Allen the sign in page.

05:02.520 --> 05:03.150
All right.

05:03.150 --> 05:07.160
You know this year that we have another issue with the form.

05:07.440 --> 05:11.100
This is a bit of a tricky one because why is this happening.

05:11.100 --> 05:19.170
We put our styles after bootstrap our tack Kyon's and our index Nazi SS is after bootstrap But this

05:19.170 --> 05:21.270
is a funny thing that's actually happening.

05:21.270 --> 05:23.600
And another reason where you want to be careful.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.190
Anything that you can port to your project.

05:26.310 --> 05:30.920
If I scroll down here I see that whereas it

05:33.870 --> 05:44.020
background transparent over here if I scroll down and toggle it will see that oh look at that.

05:44.500 --> 05:51.730
That's now while we want out of our thing but somebody is calling background transparent with the important

05:51.730 --> 05:52.640
class.

05:53.050 --> 05:54.180
And if I click here

05:56.960 --> 05:58.990
it looks like this text CSSA.

05:59.060 --> 06:01.110
Oh yeah that's bootstrap right there.

06:01.280 --> 06:07.360
So bootstrap automatically assigns the important but not place.

06:07.730 --> 06:13.650
Let's go back to the inspect element bootstrap.

06:13.660 --> 06:19.330
Automatically assigns the important flag which again overrides all C Ss.

06:19.520 --> 06:20.240
Where are we.

06:20.240 --> 06:21.190
Let's go back to

06:24.670 --> 06:26.080
scroll up and there it is.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.200
You see over here it's not being read.

06:31.340 --> 06:37.900
While we have with Kyon's and instead it's being written overwritten by the same class in the bootstrap

06:37.990 --> 06:39.480
class.

06:39.520 --> 06:48.180
Again another reason why you want to stick usually with wants VSS library because you never know what

06:48.180 --> 06:48.880
they're doing.

06:49.710 --> 06:54.570
So let's fix that really really quickly because I like the black background that we had.

06:56.330 --> 07:03.800
And a simple fix that we can do is perhaps for seinen we can create a new file we'll call to sign in

07:04.000 --> 07:15.040
dot C Ss and we can just simply override everything so let's just call this however black on hover and

07:15.040 --> 07:17.880
we'll say that this is whenever it's hovering.

07:17.890 --> 07:21.140
I want the background color

07:25.460 --> 07:27.450
to be black.

07:27.460 --> 07:33.440
Now Bruce Shepp is still going to override that because it has the important flag so we can add our

07:33.440 --> 07:36.060
own flag here saying important.

07:36.060 --> 07:37.730
Now I'm warning you here.

07:37.910 --> 07:43.820
This is just for demonstration purposes just in case you encounter something like this which often happens

07:43.820 --> 07:48.110
when you mix and match I personally never like using this.

07:48.130 --> 07:51.060
If you're using this then there's something wrong.

07:51.060 --> 07:52.930
Maybe there's better ways of doing it.

07:52.930 --> 07:58.870
In our case maybe instead of using Buscema we can do something else so it doesn't override all our styles

07:58.900 --> 08:01.760
or maybe don't use tack Collins and bootstrap together.

08:02.230 --> 08:10.310
But for now we have this Hover block that we can apply to each one of our classes in our case we can

08:10.310 --> 08:21.060
go to the register or the sign in and in the sign in we can just have a class that we add to all our

08:21.060 --> 08:22.110
inputs.

08:22.290 --> 08:24.440
We have a lot of CSSA styles already.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.830
And we should KPRC SSL.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.130
Let's go with Hover Clott hover block

08:32.000 --> 08:34.770
to hear what other imposed do we have.

08:35.090 --> 08:38.090
We have the this one over here.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.520
Let's save go back

08:43.780 --> 08:46.870
oh what i miss here.

08:46.990 --> 08:55.230
Let's go back and that's because we actually need to import our CSSA file that we just created.

08:56.330 --> 09:01.810
So again most do sign an Daut see assess.

09:01.850 --> 09:06.080
So let's test that out go back look at that.

09:06.210 --> 09:08.960
We have our background all set.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.220
We can do probably the same thing for a register.

09:11.220 --> 09:13.530
We see that that's still being affected.

09:13.620 --> 09:16.480
But that's something that you can do on your own time.

09:16.530 --> 09:20.950
We have over written a hair styles.

09:20.980 --> 09:25.720
All right so now that we got this all figured out let's go back to let's clean this up a bit.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.820
I'm going to abduct Yes all our clothes some of these tabs

09:35.070 --> 09:42.800
and go to our home and is signed in to true just so we can play around with this.

09:42.900 --> 09:45.030
If I go back there we go.

09:45.060 --> 09:50.080
I think the one last fix we want to do is this positioning of the box.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.070
Let's fix that.

09:52.250 --> 09:58.370
And that's actually a nice little fix that we can do again if we go to profile.

09:58.670 --> 10:06.080
Luckily for us with the dropdown menu there is a attribute that we can use again if we go back to our

10:06.500 --> 10:09.180
re-act trap.

10:09.340 --> 10:13.710
We have the let's see position

10:17.350 --> 10:24.400
that is up down left right and you can see over here that you can align things based on how you want

10:24.400 --> 10:24.980
them to be.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.210
In our case we want to use the right attribute.

10:29.420 --> 10:35.720
So I can just go back here and just to stay consistent for Klaas's let's keep double quotes just like

10:35.720 --> 10:36.590
we have over here.

10:36.620 --> 10:38.330
Even though you can use both.

10:38.330 --> 10:45.500
And let's just add the right attribute here that comes with 3.x chape.

10:45.540 --> 10:46.320
If I go back

10:49.250 --> 10:52.920
are eight We've got everything nice and working.

10:52.920 --> 10:56.150
I think it's time for us because our sign our functionality works.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.580
It's time for us to build our profile.

10:58.690 --> 10:59.810
That's going to be a fun one.

11:00.090 --> 11:01.190
I'll see in that one.

11:01.570 --> 11:01.860
But by.
