00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.200
Well come back and stall and good for Windows was real fun wasn't it.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.770
Now it's time to install notice on our windows machines.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:18.740
For this week visit their website noti has taught or book and pick Starla for Windows.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.400
This takes a while depending on the internet connection which you have.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.800
I've already downloaded it.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.850
OK then let's start to install it next.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:42.720
And then of course you can read through all the light sensing agreement except these that don't change

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.200
to install directory and leave it.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.440
OK.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.000
And this is an important point.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.270
Everything should be configured automatically but let's double check it.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:02.280
I will install Also this on the local drive and that the path means that this get reaches that the system

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.180
in the PATH variable which makes the note and the NPM command and waybill on your command prompt.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.910
Then hit next and install

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.150
this takes a while.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:25.950
Let me fast forward things that you don't have to wait.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.020
OK now it's finished.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.300
Finish close this.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.050
This Let's start to come out and prompt to check if it is.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.150
It's stalled probably typing no dish.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.630
We hit enter.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.440
All right.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.330
Rojan eight point twelve point Ciro.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.610
And let's check if NPM is also installed on my system.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.420
Yes it is where six point four point one.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.150
And this is holloing install not years and NPM at the same time because they ship with one installer

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.040
in the next lecture we will install postscripts Eskew on our windows machines.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.520
This one's real fun and really excited about it.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.920
I'll see you on the next one.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.580
Bye bye.
