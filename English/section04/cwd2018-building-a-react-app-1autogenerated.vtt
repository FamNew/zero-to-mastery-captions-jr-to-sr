WEBVTT

00:00.810 --> 00:04.840
It let's build our robo friends app I think to get started.

00:04.870 --> 00:07.310
We want to think about component's again.

00:07.450 --> 00:10.690
And what kind of components we want to build.

00:10.690 --> 00:16.660
Looking at this Web site the smallest component that we've probably want to start working on is perhaps

00:16.960 --> 00:21.970
the cart component this cart over here if we can build one of these.

00:21.970 --> 00:29.280
Then according to what I've said before we can just copy all these components and add them to the page.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.370
So let's start off with this.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.490
The card component.

00:34.550 --> 00:36.350
All right.

00:36.530 --> 00:40.640
Now we won't be using the halo component anymore.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.730
And if you remember it looked like this.

00:43.730 --> 00:48.700
Let's just I know it's sad but we're going to delete it when I delete the helos.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.870
SS start off clean.

00:52.290 --> 00:53.810
Song one to delete.

00:54.190 --> 01:00.020
OK.

01:00.300 --> 01:03.750
And we'll also delete hollowed out CSX.

01:03.800 --> 01:08.970
I know all our hard work just completely gone.

01:09.130 --> 01:15.010
You know we're going to start deleting things that we don't need in this project for example the app

01:15.010 --> 01:16.830
dodgiest that we had initially.

01:16.840 --> 01:23.150
Well we can delete that can also delete Abdollah CSX

01:27.400 --> 01:28.390
or test

01:32.320 --> 01:40.970
and the logo.

01:40.990 --> 01:41.430
All right.

01:41.470 --> 01:44.350
So everything's looking very small now.

01:44.410 --> 01:52.750
We have just and ex-Nazi SS index Rajai ass and this register service worker that comes with query racked

01:52.750 --> 01:54.880
up that we don't need to touch.

01:54.900 --> 02:00.910
OK obviously we have failed to compile because Walder Hello imports doesn't really work we don't have

02:00.910 --> 02:02.560
anything.

02:02.720 --> 02:03.910
So let's start off with this.

02:03.950 --> 02:15.780
Let's start off by creating a card component and this car component will have to import it from card.

02:15.890 --> 02:22.850
J.S. again if I save this still get an error because it doesn't exist.

02:22.950 --> 02:23.690
So let's create it.

02:23.700 --> 02:27.380
I'm going to say new file card.

02:27.510 --> 02:28.070
Yes.

02:30.060 --> 02:35.480
Then making sure that this is using table.

02:35.660 --> 02:38.810
And let's do what we've done before we do import

02:42.130 --> 02:43.840
re-act from

02:47.000 --> 02:51.480
instead of doing the CLOs way for now we're just going to worry about building the function.

02:51.530 --> 02:57.380
So I'm going to say Konst card equals.

02:57.380 --> 02:59.350
It won't have any properties for now.

03:00.430 --> 03:05.350
And this will return in brackets.

03:11.480 --> 03:21.270
And within here we'll say that it has a div within this div will have an image and this image will have

03:21.270 --> 03:26.100
some sort of a source that we don't know what it is yet so we'll just keep it the way it is.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.790
Closing tag and we'll have another div

03:34.720 --> 03:35.460
within here.

03:35.470 --> 03:46.930
If you remember we have our name and email in here so we'll just do an H-2 we'll just write hardcoded

03:46.940 --> 03:48.020
values here.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.280
Well Jane Jane Doe

03:52.040 --> 04:00.270
and finally a p tag that has some e-mail address solicitude Jane Doe at gmail dot com.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.540
Close the tag.

04:03.590 --> 04:03.900
All right.

04:03.920 --> 04:08.000
So we just have a simple component that's returning card.

04:08.060 --> 04:10.880
And remember we want to export this.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.480
So we want to say export default card

04:17.320 --> 04:21.440
save I get I'm geomancy must have an alt property.

04:21.580 --> 04:23.320
Again it's giving me a nice hand.

04:23.350 --> 04:29.540
So let's just add a alt property we just say what this photo is.

04:29.590 --> 04:38.820
So I'll just say photo for now or I'll say robots for now compile successfully if we look back at our

04:38.820 --> 04:46.050
app we have robots Jane Doe and Jane Doe perfect.

04:46.080 --> 04:52.800
All right we have the cart component and you must be asking yourself why are we using re-act here if

04:52.800 --> 04:54.610
we're not really using it.

04:54.780 --> 04:56.320
Let's see what happens if I remove it.

04:58.070 --> 05:07.850
I get a whole bunch of errors that says re-act must be in scope when using GSX remember GSX is this.

05:07.850 --> 05:16.620
We're not writing a shemale we're writing GSX and we need to import react so that our program understands

05:16.680 --> 05:20.090
GSX this a shemale like syntax.

05:20.190 --> 05:20.650
OK.

05:20.880 --> 05:27.390
Now we need an image and for this exercise I have something called Roble hash for you it's a really

05:27.390 --> 05:28.990
really cool API.

05:29.070 --> 05:33.180
And for those that don't know what API is or don't worry you have a session coming up with all that

05:33.180 --> 05:35.300
information well you'll get to learn about it.

05:35.490 --> 05:45.510
But the cool thing about roba hashes I can just say anything in here and it will return a random robot

05:45.510 --> 05:47.370
for me.

05:47.410 --> 05:49.450
All we need is just this.

05:49.590 --> 05:59.080
You are el and I can just say for now test.

05:59.320 --> 06:05.780
If I save this and go back to my example.

06:05.960 --> 06:06.580
There you go.

06:06.590 --> 06:08.140
We have our Random robot.

06:08.390 --> 06:17.710
If I changed this to let's say test test I save Well now I get another robot.

06:17.730 --> 06:18.750
How cool is that.

06:20.450 --> 06:27.560
All right I want to make sure that the size is somewhat small so you can do a question mark here and

06:27.560 --> 06:29.080
just give it width and height.

06:29.150 --> 06:32.810
So I'm just going to do 200 by 200.

06:32.810 --> 06:36.100
And again this is just something that you do with this.

06:36.260 --> 06:40.940
You are all that they give you and the information here how will make you go through it.

06:44.890 --> 06:48.910
Everything should look nice.

06:48.960 --> 07:00.380
Now let's say I wanted to add a title and I'll do something like divx or H-1 Pro Bowl friends here.

07:06.900 --> 07:08.130
You see I get an error here.

07:08.340 --> 07:17.380
It's because remember we need to return one thing and we can have multiple elements being returned right.

07:17.560 --> 07:21.490
If we want to return something make sure it's one thing or an array.

07:21.490 --> 07:25.470
But for now we'll worry about the title later.

07:25.480 --> 07:29.590
We want to make sure that we're only returning one element.

07:29.590 --> 07:35.510
So in this case that div element that has a ton of things inside which is the card component.

07:35.650 --> 07:38.880
All right let's save.

07:38.910 --> 07:41.570
All right we have our card component.

07:41.670 --> 07:45.690
It looks nice but what if I wanted to have multiple cards.

07:45.700 --> 07:50.270
Now according to what we know because we have the card component.

07:50.280 --> 08:00.750
If I go to index start yes I can just say I've put this on our new line so you can see I can just wrap

08:00.750 --> 08:09.030
this in a div again because we want to return just a single element and I could say Card

08:12.020 --> 08:15.980
card and close the DIV tag

08:18.620 --> 08:26.400
save and look at that we have multiple cars now they're each their own component.

08:26.490 --> 08:32.370
But let's have some styling to this just to make it look nicer again because we have Takio.

08:32.700 --> 08:38.220
We can use some really nice syntax if we go to the car component within the div..

08:38.220 --> 08:40.250
I can say class name again.

08:40.290 --> 08:47.350
Remember we can use class B.G. light green so that is background light green.

08:47.400 --> 08:51.780
And this is just tacky on classes that are already predefined for us again.

08:52.020 --> 08:54.900
CSSA section this isn't that.

08:54.900 --> 08:57.060
So we're not going to focus too much on CSSA.

08:57.090 --> 08:59.850
I'll just give you the styling say you need.

08:59.880 --> 09:07.510
Have the div the border we have padding of three lothsome margins too as well.

09:07.530 --> 09:10.020
And then it will do grow which is the animation.

09:10.020 --> 09:16.460
So if I save this look at that and that's that's pretty nice.

09:19.160 --> 09:29.930
You know it looks at a few more we'll do P.W. two and shadow five to add a bit of chateaus to them.

09:29.930 --> 09:30.560
There you go.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.430
They look more 3D now.

09:32.660 --> 09:33.880
That looks very nice.

09:35.150 --> 09:35.480
There you go.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.360
We have our cards again.

09:37.370 --> 09:44.020
We don't want this static card where it says Jane Doe Jane Doe Jane Doe we want it to be dynamic right.

09:44.050 --> 09:52.990
So it sounds like we need what we call prop's properties well and actually have for you a robot's object

09:52.990 --> 09:53.980
that I've created.

09:53.980 --> 10:00.580
So I'm just going to add a new file here that says robots dodgy us and one thing here.

10:00.580 --> 10:06.760
I'm just going to copy and paste this as you can see it is just a constant object it's robots it's an

10:06.790 --> 10:16.350
array of objects and it has ID name user name email and these are just random that I've made.

10:16.470 --> 10:21.380
If you want this file then you can grab the files from the end of this section.

10:21.550 --> 10:26.170
But for now this way I have something that I can use and you can see I'm exporting it.

10:26.350 --> 10:35.990
I can say import robots from Dot because we're in the same directory.

10:36.430 --> 10:38.940
Robots.

10:39.020 --> 10:48.740
Now if I save this we got robots as defined by never used but because this is using export instead of

10:48.740 --> 10:52.580
export default this file could have multiple exports.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.670
It just so happens that I only have one.

10:54.830 --> 11:01.910
The rule is for these phones because there are default Well you can just to cart for ones that aren't

11:01.910 --> 11:02.590
default.

11:02.690 --> 11:05.470
You have to restructure it.

11:05.630 --> 11:06.970
That is like this.

11:06.980 --> 11:14.890
So that if I have another variable let's say that says Katz then I will have to do that to grab it.

11:16.160 --> 11:21.880
So we have robots and now I can't give it some properties.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.290
I can say ID equals.

11:24.320 --> 11:33.080
And again we have these brackets so that it's a javascript expression and we'll say robots but robots

11:34.540 --> 11:44.010
first array dog ID has the ID then we have name equals robots.

11:44.100 --> 11:50.890
Again the first user thought name close to bracket.

11:51.160 --> 12:03.280
And then we also have email he calls robots first and the array dot email.

12:03.390 --> 12:10.500
Holy moly that's a lot of typing and I'm going to make this more just so you can see I'm going to copy

12:10.500 --> 12:15.600
and paste for the other ones as well except for.

12:15.630 --> 12:27.770
Change this to the second user and then the third use the second user

12:31.720 --> 12:39.700
Now if I save this it's compiled successfully but nothing has changed because we need to go to cards

12:39.700 --> 12:46.750
and get a close robust dodgiest for now and this because cards it needs to now accept parameters and

12:46.750 --> 12:47.770
what are the parameters.

12:47.770 --> 12:56.200
While it's properties and these props are now props Daut name

13:01.120 --> 13:02.390
props dot

13:05.730 --> 13:08.600
I save that go back.

13:08.780 --> 13:13.370
It's not working well because this is a javascript expression.

13:13.370 --> 13:13.880
Right.

13:13.910 --> 13:17.740
So I need to wrap it in curly brackets.

13:18.760 --> 13:23.660
Just the way it works in GSX save Look at that.

13:23.700 --> 13:29.910
We have dynamic names that we're passing as properties to each one.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.860
Let's add tech center here.

13:33.750 --> 13:34.620
And there you go.

13:34.620 --> 13:35.840
Now we have everything Center.

13:35.910 --> 13:38.440
That's a lot better OK.

13:38.450 --> 13:42.170
But we also passed ID we can use ID to do something cool.

13:42.200 --> 13:47.800
If you remember in that ESX section we have template strings.

13:48.080 --> 13:55.060
And because this is a template string we have to wrap it in a curly bracket so it's a javascript expression.

13:55.310 --> 14:03.380
And now within the robo hash instead of using test here we can randomize what robots we get by using

14:03.860 --> 14:05.330
this syntax as you remember.

14:05.450 --> 14:08.530
And in here we can just say Propst dot ID.

14:08.870 --> 14:15.970
So now this will say Roble hashed out org ID of whatever it is for the robot with the size.

14:15.970 --> 14:20.170
So we make sure that again the IDs are always dynamic and changing.

14:20.170 --> 14:28.940
If I save this and go back look at you see that there's a bit of a delay again because we're talking

14:28.940 --> 14:31.370
to the API and the API is returning.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.740
Answer for us but how cool is that.

14:33.770 --> 14:37.330
We just created our own dynamic cards.

14:39.330 --> 14:46.060
One last thing although this works something nicer that you can do is we have something called destructuring.

14:46.290 --> 14:48.450
We can do something like Konst

14:50.880 --> 15:00.010
name email equals props again as you may remember from E6.

15:00.320 --> 15:05.400
And now I can use outside ideas well

15:11.220 --> 15:12.600
and it still works.

15:14.190 --> 15:21.100
Another cool thing that you can do and this is even cleaner is within the parameters you can do destructuring.

15:21.570 --> 15:23.790
Again you can add this over here now.

15:28.660 --> 15:34.730
And now if I save it should still work and it does.

15:34.920 --> 15:42.030
This might be confusing if you're new to destructuring But as you saw step by step we're just receiving

15:42.030 --> 15:46.150
props and we're destructuring the props right inside of the brackets here.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.390
This is much cleaner.

15:50.700 --> 15:51.420
All right.

15:51.420 --> 15:54.150
That was a lot of fun in a really really fast way.

15:54.150 --> 16:00.150
We've just created our own cartes in the next section we're going to expand on this and make this even

16:00.150 --> 16:01.050
better.

16:01.140 --> 16:02.790
I'll see that one but by.
