00:01.310 --> 00:02.180
Welcome back.

00:02.480 --> 00:08.560
Let's keep going with our star of security and talk about code secrets and with code secrets.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.120
It's quite simple actually.

00:10.280 --> 00:12.330
There's two main things we want to focus on.

00:13.230 --> 00:19.260
Environmental variables and commit history.

00:19.270 --> 00:24.290
Let's take a look at both I have here our robo friends up.

00:24.290 --> 00:25.310
Nothing too crazy.

00:25.310 --> 00:27.500
Same old same old.

00:27.510 --> 00:34.770
There are many times in our apps where we have important information that we might want to hide.

00:34.890 --> 00:42.750
For example sometimes we have an API key like we do in the smart brain app with the clarify API that

00:42.780 --> 00:50.080
API key allows us to send an HTP request to clarify and clarify for them to respond to us.

00:50.830 --> 00:56.710
There's also times where we might want to connect to a database and we need a password and user and

00:56.710 --> 01:01.490
perhaps there are other secrets that we want to have.

01:02.520 --> 01:07.130
Or maybe even simply we just need to have extra variables.

01:07.170 --> 01:10.880
What we call environmental variables in our development purposes.

01:11.100 --> 01:19.080
Let me show you how this would work in roba France for example out of the box with create re-act up

01:19.320 --> 01:26.930
we have access to let's console log this process dot and Dot node

01:29.510 --> 01:30.850
and variable.

01:31.040 --> 01:34.210
And this is saying in this process that we're running.

01:34.520 --> 01:37.460
Give me the environment variable node.

01:37.670 --> 01:39.020
And where did this come from.

01:39.050 --> 01:42.580
This is just default that's set by Crais up.

01:42.620 --> 01:51.890
If I save this and go back and let's take a look at our cons. We have our logger but we see that we

01:51.890 --> 01:59.870
have the R log over here devolvement and this is done by default because internally Cray re-act app

02:00.170 --> 02:07.940
gives us the node M version and when we run this it says ah we're running in devolvement let's set up

02:07.940 --> 02:14.460
the app so that it's better for devolvement purposes when we actually run NPM run build old changed

02:14.490 --> 02:21.880
this note environment to production so that it's able to say OK this is for production not for devolvement.

02:21.890 --> 02:27.140
I'm going to minimize the code I'm going to do all these optimizations use libraries that are optimized

02:27.140 --> 02:29.440
for productions and do all these things.

02:29.480 --> 02:38.510
So environment variables are useful for example I could say that if node environment was production.

02:38.720 --> 02:49.470
I want to add Google Analytics for example I guess say if Yeah if process no-God and

02:52.390 --> 02:56.210
calls production then in this block

02:59.660 --> 03:05.220
we get say run Google Analytics or anything we want and you'll see that a lot but let's get back to

03:05.220 --> 03:06.240
security here.

03:07.550 --> 03:16.100
We now have a way to inject the variables into this app from the outside world from the environment.

03:16.100 --> 03:27.040
And by doing that we can inject passwords database passwords usernames and API keys or even variables

03:27.040 --> 03:30.830
that we might need from the environment for our app to work.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.100
And the way we can do this with create react up and don't worry I'll show you how to do it outside of

03:36.100 --> 03:42.970
CCRI react up as well is to create a dot and 5 and file loops.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.770
So we do dot the end the

03:47.910 --> 03:50.050
and I've actually already created one over here.

03:52.830 --> 03:59.100
And in this M-file I can add anything that I want with one condition.

03:59.100 --> 04:04.500
We have to add the re-act app Prefect's and after this I can say whatever I want.

04:04.500 --> 04:09.960
So let's say say hi equals to high.

04:10.280 --> 04:12.590
No quotes here just the way it is.

04:12.680 --> 04:13.810
Save it like that.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.560
And now let's copy this.

04:16.760 --> 04:22.310
And now Konsole logged the process thought anf re-act app say hi.

04:22.550 --> 04:27.660
Except we don't need that equals now because that's the variable.

04:28.100 --> 04:33.920
And I'm going to you might need to restart the server for this to work so we don't run NPM start again.

04:37.540 --> 04:40.130
Let's wait for it to load.

04:40.250 --> 04:45.020
And if I scroll up well I might have to save this first.

04:45.020 --> 04:45.730
Silly me.

04:45.740 --> 04:48.420
Let's rerun NPM start again.

04:50.380 --> 04:53.030
Yes use a different port

04:56.580 --> 04:57.850
and look at that.

04:58.320 --> 04:59.990
I get high.

05:00.360 --> 05:07.650
So using this I can securely add passwords to my app.

05:07.990 --> 05:09.980
For example let me show you get help.

05:11.970 --> 05:14.220
If we go to the smart brain project

05:20.310 --> 05:21.240
look back at

05:25.720 --> 05:36.390
let's go to the Smar brain boost API and in here if I go into controllers image you see how I have the

05:36.480 --> 05:42.480
API key over here as your API key here.

05:42.640 --> 05:49.740
Well I don't want to commit or show to the public my API key for clarify because let's say you're paying

05:49.740 --> 05:50.550
for that API.

05:50.640 --> 05:56.370
Well you don't want anybody to have access to it because if they do then anybody can access and use

05:56.370 --> 05:58.970
your clarify count in here.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.660
I could have done process.

06:00.720 --> 06:09.720
Have your API key here and then every time I download this app I have my dot M-file and that already

06:09.720 --> 06:17.400
has my passwords and my keys already set and I can just run it and that's how companies usually deploy

06:17.970 --> 06:25.590
they deploy apps by having process thought Ampe dot some sort of a variable key and each place where

06:25.590 --> 06:30.720
they deploy they have a environment file that is kept completely secret.

06:30.720 --> 06:37.030
Remember most of the time these are secrets that you don't want the world to know.

06:37.320 --> 06:44.970
So sometimes you see Dot private folder that has all your environment variables for production staging

06:45.300 --> 06:47.370
local and different environments.

06:47.370 --> 06:51.600
The idea is to keep these as secret as possible.

06:51.620 --> 06:52.800
Now this does.

06:52.810 --> 07:00.250
And if that comes with Crais react up is actually a package NAPM that anybody can use.

07:00.290 --> 07:05.110
And underneath the hood this package is used by Create react up.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.270
But even if you're not running create react up.

07:08.390 --> 07:10.990
You can just simply use it by NPM installing.

07:11.030 --> 07:14.060
And they have fairly good documentation.

07:14.060 --> 07:19.030
You can see over here for DB user password and host I can use this.

07:19.160 --> 07:25.380
And now I can use process thought Ampe DOB D-B password user and host.

07:25.550 --> 07:33.290
And this is the recommended way of making sure that your app runs and knows secrets that shouldn't be

07:33.290 --> 07:35.730
shared with anybody in a secure fashion.

07:36.570 --> 07:39.330
Now those are environment variables.

07:40.470 --> 07:44.570
And I want to show you something interesting and this something they should be careful of.

07:44.820 --> 07:51.480
Get hub has a commit history whether you delete your comments or anything you're always going to have

07:51.480 --> 08:01.050
this commit history so you'll never ever ever want to put up your secret files on to get help because

08:01.110 --> 08:02.510
those are public.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.190
So always use a dog.

08:05.280 --> 08:11.670
Ignore file or never ever ever ever do any passwords or API keys and commit history.

08:11.910 --> 08:14.880
Let me demonstrate why.

08:15.080 --> 08:21.200
If you go to get help the search over here and again be responsible with this knowledge.

08:21.200 --> 08:25.310
Don't use it for nefarious reasons that means bad reasons.

08:25.550 --> 08:30.360
But if I type in remove Ru Let's try that again.

08:30.360 --> 08:36.890
Remove password press enter and I go to commit.

08:37.230 --> 08:44.670
Oh and this is under my search but let's go back to our side of this repo's a repository to the main

08:45.060 --> 08:46.300
site and try that again.

08:46.380 --> 08:49.180
Remove password

08:52.120 --> 08:53.370
and go to commit.

08:53.380 --> 08:58.290
I have 38 million commits that have.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.680
Let's go to comments here.

08:59.680 --> 09:08.740
Three hundred eighty nine thousand commits that have removed password wars and so I now see where people

09:08.770 --> 09:11.590
have removed their database password

09:14.350 --> 09:18.470
and this is for everybody to see.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.800
That's not very good is it.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.220
Again use this responsibly.

09:23.410 --> 09:29.530
This is just a demonstration to show you you do not ever commit anything to get Hobb.

09:29.530 --> 09:37.720
That is a secret and if you do by mistake since this commed result is going to be there you're going

09:37.720 --> 09:41.650
to have to change your password secrets whatever they are immediately.

09:41.920 --> 09:42.860
And there you have it.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.140
Code secrets.

09:44.140 --> 09:45.400
Be careful with them.

09:45.430 --> 09:46.130
Hide them.

09:46.180 --> 09:47.130
Protect them.

09:47.440 --> 09:48.940
I'll see in the next one.

09:49.150 --> 09:49.390
Babai.
