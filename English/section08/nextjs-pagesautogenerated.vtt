WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:09.170
All right let's make our up a little bit bigger than just an H1 tack Kerry add new pages here.

00:09.530 --> 00:10.700
Well let's have a look.

00:10.700 --> 00:21.360
If I do new file and let's say we're going to have an About page so about dodginess And this about page

00:21.510 --> 00:31.870
let's say well of same syntax we'll call it about and again we're just creating a simple component here.

00:32.950 --> 00:39.060
And we're going to return let's return let's return.

00:39.290 --> 00:40.500
In other div

00:44.720 --> 00:53.610
and inside of this div we'll just have an H1 tag that says about very exciting what page I know Let's

00:53.850 --> 00:54.860
export default

00:58.080 --> 00:59.260
and see what happens.

01:00.500 --> 01:00.870
All right.

01:00.890 --> 01:03.010
If I go back to my Web page.

01:03.020 --> 01:11.490
Ok I still see S.R. magician but if I go now to the boat you are Al.

01:11.620 --> 01:12.140
Look at that.

01:12.150 --> 01:14.690
I'm on the About page.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.040
How cool is that.

01:16.060 --> 01:21.750
Simply just putting files underneath the pages creates new pages for us.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.920
But we have a problem here now right.

01:23.920 --> 01:27.700
How can we link these two pages together because that's how web sites work.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.640
You have links between pages.

01:29.650 --> 01:32.080
Well let's just experiment with something.

01:32.080 --> 01:43.170
What if I add an atack here with the ref that he calls let's say about dodgiest

01:46.170 --> 01:48.950
and just close the attack here.

01:49.140 --> 01:50.710
We'll see if that works.

01:50.820 --> 01:57.360
I save go back to the index page and I have the about 2 over here if I click on it.

01:59.610 --> 02:01.250
I go to about Dodge.

02:01.270 --> 02:02.300
Yes.

02:02.550 --> 02:13.170
That link can be found because with next we just give it the end point that we want so about because

02:13.210 --> 02:16.280
well that's how Atra fork's we need an actual euro.

02:16.360 --> 02:17.170
So if I save

02:19.710 --> 02:25.030
and go back to our index click on a boat look at that we're on the About page now.

02:25.050 --> 02:26.560
How cool is that.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.840
Now check this out.

02:27.900 --> 02:35.250
If I open up the network tab and I refresh the page all right I get a ton of stuff with web pack and

02:35.610 --> 02:36.200
other things.

02:36.210 --> 02:39.300
But we got the index saw japes file.

02:39.300 --> 02:45.450
If I close this now and I click on the boat and you see that there's some background tasks happening

02:45.810 --> 02:53.900
don't worry too much about that if I click on about there you know my About page my About page just

02:53.900 --> 03:00.800
got loaded which is the standard way that we see server side rendered or older generation of web sites

03:00.890 --> 03:08.710
work but next provides a really cool tool for us to actually have client side writing.

03:08.790 --> 03:17.230
Let me show you what I mean in next you can you have access to something called a link component and

03:17.230 --> 03:22.680
this link component can be grabbed from the next link.

03:22.750 --> 03:30.160
So this is just saying from the next package grab the link component and now instead of using the tag

03:31.320 --> 03:38.730
let's comment this out instead of using the tag we can say link

03:41.990 --> 03:43.070
HSF.

03:43.120 --> 03:47.040
It calls to about

03:50.020 --> 03:59.550
and just close this link back and inside of here we can just give it a say and a tag that is about.

03:59.630 --> 04:05.640
All right so let's say that and close this for now let's see if it works.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.830
I go back here click on about.

04:07.830 --> 04:08.100
All right.

04:08.100 --> 04:09.040
It's working.

04:11.310 --> 04:11.850
Also.

04:11.880 --> 04:12.430
Next slide.

04:12.490 --> 04:13.140
Yes.

04:13.140 --> 04:20.630
Has the built in writing so we can go back and forth just like we would in a browser in a regular web

04:20.630 --> 04:25.430
site to go back and forth which is actually quite difficult when you do client side routing.

04:25.650 --> 04:28.920
But again everything just works out of the box.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.330
Nice and easy.

04:31.680 --> 04:34.240
And by the way I can do anything I want here.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.150
Not just an a tag if I do button here.

04:39.140 --> 04:48.680
And I save this go back here I click on About look at that I'm able to go back or go to the About page

04:49.990 --> 04:56.530
and this is very cool with the link tag as we can wrap anything we want and a link tag and it becomes

04:56.530 --> 04:57.210
a link.

04:57.220 --> 05:05.970
All we need to give it is an RF nice and simple let's make our About page a little bit snazzier again

05:06.060 --> 05:11.480
again nothing crazy here but we know how styles work with reactor's All right.

05:11.480 --> 05:17.370
I can say font size is 20 pixels.

05:17.380 --> 05:23.700
Make sure it's the string and maybe a lot a color

05:26.880 --> 05:28.350
a color of

05:31.740 --> 05:35.770
let's save go back.

05:35.790 --> 05:36.480
All right.

05:36.480 --> 05:37.350
Very cool.

05:37.470 --> 05:40.140
Nice and easy styling as well.

05:40.140 --> 05:40.380
All right.

05:40.380 --> 05:46.350
I'm going to make the About page just a little bit more stylish than what we have now so let's just

05:46.620 --> 05:55.800
add over here perhaps a while we'll leave the header the way it is but we'll also add a link.

05:55.830 --> 06:07.350
Again we have to import that up here so we'll say import link from our next link package and the link

06:07.350 --> 06:08.900
will just say Tref.

06:08.970 --> 06:14.880
We wanted to go to the homepage so I'll just say back to the home page

06:18.090 --> 06:30.670
and inside of this link we'll just have a backbone so I'll just give it a button that says back.

06:30.840 --> 06:44.570
And then finally maybe the bottom will also have a p tag that says I was a magician once.

06:46.430 --> 06:48.590
Very descriptive about age.

06:48.650 --> 06:54.530
Let's save and go to the above page who was a magician once.

06:54.530 --> 07:00.800
If I go back everything is working and I know this doesn't look super super impressive but the fact

07:00.800 --> 07:07.580
that we can do client side routing like this is actually very very nice.

07:07.730 --> 07:14.050
It is a tough problem that with Korea react up on the front and you'd have to use something like re-act

07:14.060 --> 07:20.540
rudder to implemented and although that is easy as we call it it's still especially hard when he worked

07:20.540 --> 07:22.060
with server side rendered.

07:22.070 --> 07:25.830
So this is just out of the box very easy.

07:25.850 --> 07:26.520
All right.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.520
More awesome stuff from next.

07:28.550 --> 07:32.210
Coming up next video that's funny I said next to many taps.

07:32.210 --> 07:32.600
All right.

07:32.690 --> 07:33.940
I'll see you in the next one.

07:33.950 --> 07:34.540
Bye bye.
