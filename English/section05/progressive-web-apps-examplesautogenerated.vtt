00:01.430 --> 00:08.080
Think of a progressive webapp more like a running list of things you can do they in a static list it's

00:08.090 --> 00:09.460
going to evolve over time.

00:09.500 --> 00:16.370
But the idea is to make user experience as we know as close as possible to a native app.

00:16.490 --> 00:22.690
By the way maybe you don't trust me maybe you think that this progressive Web app is just pure hype

00:22.690 --> 00:26.480
and is just teaching us something that won't exists in two years.

00:26.710 --> 00:30.600
Well companies like Twitter

00:33.630 --> 00:40.890
have adopted progressive Web apps so much so that Twitter has moved all of their mobile web traffic

00:41.220 --> 00:52.450
to a re-act progressive Web app Alibaba dotcom Yeah they use a progressive Web app Lyft and uber uses

00:52.480 --> 00:59.170
a progressive Web app Lyft for example has a goal of making their progressive Web app a 100 percent

00:59.470 --> 01:08.170
parity or half complete feature set that their mobile phone has their mobile app has to be the exact

01:08.170 --> 01:17.130
same as their web app and there's tons of companies that are adopting progressive Web apps because it

01:17.130 --> 01:18.820
is so beneficial.

01:18.840 --> 01:27.480
Let me show you a few examples to really emphasize and make you understand what this is.

01:27.480 --> 01:35.100
One of the great examples that I like is this polka dot org Web site a very very simple web site that

01:35.280 --> 01:37.640
shows you on information.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.770
Everybody loves that.

01:40.180 --> 01:45.960
Now this is a progressive Web app well.

01:46.000 --> 01:46.850
How so.

01:48.120 --> 01:57.460
If I go open up the developer tools and you see over here if I click on the icon that shows toggle device

01:57.460 --> 02:00.980
toolbar and I scroll down here

02:03.950 --> 02:12.320
well show me the mobile view of this app let me scroll down so we can see it fully and we see over here

02:12.320 --> 02:15.130
that it looks pretty good on mobile.

02:15.230 --> 02:17.180
I can even turn it around.

02:18.470 --> 02:21.830
And we also have the menu that's working.

02:22.740 --> 02:32.600
But the cool part about this is if I turn off my wife I which usually gives us that blank page with

02:32.600 --> 02:36.120
the dinosaur on Chrome saying we don't have an internet connection.

02:37.180 --> 02:38.490
Well check this out.

02:38.530 --> 02:43.670
This still works.

02:43.710 --> 02:44.680
How cool is that.

02:45.950 --> 02:53.000
If I had this on my phone even though I don't have an internet connection I'd be able to still check

02:53.000 --> 02:55.700
out all these pokey months.

02:55.700 --> 02:58.100
All right let's turn back the Wi-Fi.

03:00.030 --> 03:08.200
And take a look at another Web site and this is the hacker news progressive Web apps and you can think

03:08.200 --> 03:14.410
of it as a playground where people try and rebuild the hacker news web site using a progressive Web

03:14.410 --> 03:15.060
app.

03:15.460 --> 03:18.370
And you can see here it gives us the lighthouse score.

03:18.580 --> 03:26.710
It gives us some important metrics like how fast our Web page loads and you can even look at the code

03:26.800 --> 03:30.720
of people that have implemented this.

03:30.730 --> 03:37.240
Now let's click on the View app over here for one of the examples and we see over here that we just

03:37.240 --> 03:41.770
have a simple Hacker News Web site.

03:41.820 --> 03:48.030
The cool part about this and this is a thing that we'll talk about later on in the videos is if I open

03:48.030 --> 03:51.780
this tab and let's scroll this tab up now.

03:54.640 --> 04:05.350
And we go to application scroll all the way up to what we call the manifest we see over here that there

04:05.350 --> 04:12.820
is a add to homescreen button and this ad to homescreen button appears for mobile users.

04:12.820 --> 04:19.330
If I visited this site multiple times it's going to have a pop up and you might have seen this while

04:19.330 --> 04:24.240
browsing the web as well that says hey do you want to add this to your home screen.

04:24.370 --> 04:33.570
You see over here if I click that I get this little notification if I click on Add I can add the application

04:33.660 --> 04:38.130
will keep the name the same.

04:38.390 --> 04:50.540
And now on my desktop and now on my desktop look at that I have prepacked Hacker News app straight on

04:50.540 --> 04:55.930
this desktop and it opens up right away.

04:56.270 --> 05:05.790
If I turned off the Wi-Fi and opened this up again we see that it still works.

05:05.820 --> 05:06.820
How cool is that.

05:06.870 --> 05:10.580
And you still see your Albar because this is a browser.

05:10.650 --> 05:16.410
But if we were on a mobile phone you actually wouldn't see this.

05:16.410 --> 05:21.050
You are Albar and it will feel completely like an app.

05:21.150 --> 05:24.240
Very very cool.

05:24.240 --> 05:30.000
You see here that we don't completely have full features because you still need Wi-Fi for some parts

05:30.240 --> 05:31.490
but that's ok right.

05:31.560 --> 05:34.720
Because native apps work like that too.

05:37.450 --> 05:38.060
There you go.

05:38.190 --> 05:39.100
Starting to load now.

05:41.690 --> 05:42.210
All right.

05:42.260 --> 05:48.800
So I think that's enough examples to prove to you that maybe we should consider doing this whole progressive

05:48.800 --> 05:53.770
Web app thing in the next few videos.

05:53.810 --> 05:59.840
I'm going to show you the three most important parts to build our own progressive Web and we're going

05:59.840 --> 06:07.400
to talk about these three topics so that our robo friends app is going to be a progressive Web app by

06:07.400 --> 06:09.080
the end of this section.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.960
And Bruno is going to love us for it.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.510
We'll see in the next one.

06:13.790 --> 06:14.060
Probably.
