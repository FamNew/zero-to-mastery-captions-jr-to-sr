WEBVTT

00:02.180 --> 00:03.280
We'll come back.

00:03.640 --> 00:10.780
As developers we know that the Internet as we know it is at the end of the day submarine cables land

00:10.780 --> 00:17.400
wires satellites signal towers that allow us to connect to other computers.

00:17.800 --> 00:21.270
And this is something that we have discussed already in my previous scores.

00:22.200 --> 00:28.650
The one clear thing about this fact is that every time we open up the browser and visit a Web site we

00:28.650 --> 00:36.850
have to send a request somewhere to a server to get the files off of that computer and back all the

00:36.850 --> 00:37.720
way to us.

00:37.810 --> 00:42.490
So the browser can display the web page using those files.

00:42.550 --> 00:50.250
The fact that we can almost instantly type google.com and get a web page is honestly a miracle.

00:50.260 --> 00:56.710
So in this video let's talk about how to improve this process to make sure that you maximize this network

00:56.710 --> 00:57.620
performance.

00:58.480 --> 01:04.420
Luckily for us there are nice and easy to mean things we can do to make sure we are doing it right.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.430
I like to call these two main factors.

01:08.440 --> 01:13.180
Honey I shrunk the files and the traveling delivery man.

01:13.180 --> 01:17.420
Before you make fun of me for not naming this properly you should know that one.

01:17.530 --> 01:23.560
I thought this was hilarious when I was writing the script for the video and to trust me you won't forget

01:23.560 --> 01:26.640
these two by the end of this video this way.

01:26.650 --> 01:28.870
Anyway back to being Seer's.

01:28.870 --> 01:36.040
Remember to view a web page your computer has to download all the related files from the server to display

01:36.040 --> 01:37.750
them in the browser.

01:37.750 --> 01:44.280
The more kilobytes a user needs to download the longer it takes to load the website.

01:44.280 --> 01:47.210
We also have to carry these files across the Internet.

01:48.100 --> 01:53.310
So the less work we involve here the better our website performance.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.640
So let's talk about the first one.

01:54.640 --> 01:55.980
Honey I shrunk the files.

01:56.960 --> 01:57.430
All right.

01:57.430 --> 02:01.420
How do you reduce the size of your sites files.

02:02.300 --> 02:04.070
Well pretty simple rate.

02:04.220 --> 02:12.470
By minimizing the tax files like a shemale CSSA and Javascript and by optimizing images and using smaller

02:12.470 --> 02:16.130
images when your site is viewed on a smaller screen size.

02:16.130 --> 02:22.350
For example therefore there is less data we need to transfer over the wire.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.290
I like to think of it like this.

02:24.310 --> 02:29.040
It's like putting your website on a cleansing diet and make sure everything is nice and small.

02:29.840 --> 02:36.280
Now the first three files the minimize text it's quite easy.

02:36.280 --> 02:44.420
A simple java script and CSSA can be simply magnified by taking the code that you have and using something

02:44.420 --> 02:45.650
like ugly file.

02:45.740 --> 02:46.760
Yes.

02:46.760 --> 02:52.020
Let me show you over here we have an online version of ugly file.

02:52.110 --> 02:52.980
Yes.

02:53.590 --> 03:00.810
And what it does is let's say if I have a function here you can see that it's parsing it in real time.

03:01.920 --> 03:05.130
But if I have a function that says say hello

03:08.750 --> 03:13.970
and let's say that this function just simply does a nice console log.

03:14.290 --> 03:23.830
And Lou you can see over here that it's minimizing the output so it's removing the whitespace and making

03:23.830 --> 03:25.240
it a lot smaller.

03:25.250 --> 03:31.660
This shows us that it saved 45 bytes and saved thirty eight point three six percent.

03:31.660 --> 03:36.080
Very cool.

03:36.100 --> 03:40.490
So you can do something like this for a steam mill and see Asus.

03:40.600 --> 03:44.150
Let's go back to the slide and we can use something like ugly.

03:44.230 --> 03:46.810
Yes because machines are reading the code.

03:46.810 --> 03:53.500
They don't care about indentation or good names and functions by many filing these files and removing

03:53.500 --> 03:54.510
the whitespace.

03:54.540 --> 03:57.040
You remove some bytes and make file smaller.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.090
Easy peasy right.

03:59.410 --> 04:04.720
By the way people used to do this manually just like I showed you on the web site but now this is part

04:04.720 --> 04:09.760
of what we called a build process when an app is ready for production.

04:09.760 --> 04:14.680
We'll use something like wetback to minimize all of these files and make them smaller.

04:14.680 --> 04:19.210
But don't worry we'll learn more about this and the wetback video.

04:19.210 --> 04:25.840
Now let's talk about the second one a little bit tougher because images are a little bit more complex.

04:26.780 --> 04:33.110
Well I shouldn't say more complex but this is often the easiest thing to improve on your website and

04:33.140 --> 04:37.950
also the most commonly misused to slow down your upset.

04:37.990 --> 04:42.010
So let's talk a little bit more about this in the next video.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.710
I'll see in that one.

04:43.820 --> 04:44.060
Bebai.
