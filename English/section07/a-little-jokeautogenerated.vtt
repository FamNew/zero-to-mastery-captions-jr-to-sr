Congratulations you can officially laugh at a programming job because you understand it now.

00:09.450 --> 00:12.090
Let's see did you get it.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.570
Well this is funny.

00:14.650 --> 00:24.340
If you're nerdy like me because Java is a strongly typed language and it's extremely verbose that is

00:25.120 --> 00:33.010
you write a lot of code to actually get something done which can be a good thing and is part of the

00:33.010 --> 00:34.170
reason people love Java.

00:34.330 --> 00:41.020
But congratulations you've achieved the extra special level of being able to laugh at programming jokes

00:41.620 --> 00:44.930
go show off to your friends and tell them how smart you are.

00:45.060 --> 00:47.000
See in the next video by.
