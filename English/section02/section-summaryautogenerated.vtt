00:01.640 --> 00:09.700
Let's review what we've just learned in the section we learned that Diffie Hellman key exchange provides

00:09.700 --> 00:17.950
for us a way to share a shared secret and arrive at a symmetric key so that we have two computers who

00:17.950 --> 00:19.930
are able to talk to one another.

00:19.930 --> 00:29.170
So we were able to talk to our Digital Ocean Linux server and we also used hashing to make sure that

00:29.380 --> 00:35.050
the messages are in tampered with and that there's no funny business.

00:35.060 --> 00:42.340
Finally we had to authenticate the user in two ways we could either provide a password to say hey we

00:42.340 --> 00:50.890
are who we are and we have the right to access the server or we could do something like RSA which again

00:50.950 --> 01:01.360
allows us to provide or allows us to prove the identity of the person or we could use SSH keys and

01:01.360 --> 01:07.810
something called RSA which allows us to prove the identity of the person without a password.

01:07.810 --> 01:14.980
So you see now how these four steps using those three technologies the symmetric encryption asymmetric

01:14.980 --> 01:21.250
encryption and hashing are able to combine all of these together to make sure that we can communicate

01:21.370 --> 01:23.550
securely.

01:23.570 --> 01:30.470
We now have a way for us to connect the client to the host and do all sorts of exciting things that

01:30.470 --> 01:33.500
will encounter later on in the course.

01:33.710 --> 01:37.980
And the beauty is that you now understand how GitHub works.

01:40.070 --> 01:41.390
We're the client.

01:41.390 --> 01:49.400
We have a laptop and we want to connect to GitHub which is a host of remote host and GitHub is just

01:49.400 --> 01:57.110
a server that holds our code and they're able to have multiple SSH keys on their server to make sure

01:57.110 --> 01:59.820
that they allow access to the right person.

02:00.170 --> 02:06.050
So if you own the repo and you can prove that you own the report get help well get how we'll hold that

02:06.050 --> 02:12.670
SSH for you and we'll verify every time you make and get comments.

02:12.700 --> 02:20.380
And finally using all the technologies we've used we're able to keep away bad men who want to peek into

02:20.380 --> 02:22.390
our traffic.

02:22.600 --> 02:29.800
So it's finally the end of the day on our first day at Keiko Corp. Bruno, the eccentric that he is, is

02:29.800 --> 02:34.890
very very excited to get you on board it and he's very impressed that you've got all your get help.

02:34.890 --> 02:38.040
SSH keys sorted so that you're ready for tomorrow.

02:38.230 --> 02:43.870
I have a feeling that he's going to be asking a lot of us but I think we got this.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.220
I'll see in the next one.

02:45.520 --> 02:45.880
Buh-bye.
