00:00.580 --> 00:09.110
Walk them back it's time to see if we can run our entire up our smart brain app with the docker container.

00:09.130 --> 00:13.610
Let's go back to our app going to make this a little bit smaller.

00:15.300 --> 00:17.860
Want to remove this since we don't need it for now.

00:18.780 --> 00:20.520
You don't need any console logs.

00:20.550 --> 00:27.000
All we want to do since our app is running on port 3000 is go back to our front end and say NPM start

00:31.040 --> 00:33.220
yes let's run on a different port.

00:35.510 --> 00:40.940
And this is a little bit messed up because I zoomed in.

00:41.140 --> 00:44.900
Let's try that to 100 percent better.

00:44.900 --> 00:50.790
Let me refresh your.

00:50.810 --> 00:51.270
All right.

00:51.350 --> 00:52.380
That's better.

00:52.410 --> 00:54.450
Now let's try and register here.

00:54.680 --> 00:59.150
I'm going to create a new user Tim at gmail dot com.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.220
Whoops that should be the name.

01:01.250 --> 01:05.420
Let's do Tim and then Tim at gmail dot com.

01:05.660 --> 01:12.630
Tim register.

01:13.140 --> 01:18.360
We're getting an error status 400 of register.

01:18.360 --> 01:19.820
Why is that.

01:19.890 --> 01:27.060
We go back we look at the logs of our container and all right look at that.

01:27.140 --> 01:31.050
We have an air relation log in does not exist.

01:31.100 --> 01:32.780
So we tried to insert.

01:32.780 --> 01:37.920
All right so it's working but we haven't created the tables have we.

01:38.150 --> 01:43.920
Because in order for progress to work we need those log in and user tables.

01:44.360 --> 01:47.690
So in the next video we're going to finish up all of this.

01:47.780 --> 01:54.730
We're going to create these tables in our docker container so that once everything is done we're hands

01:54.730 --> 01:56.770
free we don't have to worry about it again.

01:56.790 --> 02:03.540
I know this is a long section and we're trying to do a lot of things but stick with me in the next video

02:03.990 --> 02:05.650
we're going to get everything working.

02:05.790 --> 02:07.020
I'll see on that one.

02:07.260 --> 02:07.470
Bob.
