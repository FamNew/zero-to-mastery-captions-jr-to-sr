00:01.520 --> 00:03.320
Let's add another component here.

00:03.380 --> 00:09.810
But this time instead of pages Let's actually add a component that we can use on our pages.

00:10.010 --> 00:13.880
And here we can just create a component folder let's say components

00:17.280 --> 00:20.640
and this could be up here or we could be inside of pages.

00:20.720 --> 00:26.340
It doesn't really matter pages as the only default folder that you need for next year yes.

00:26.400 --> 00:35.670
So in the components folder Let's create an let's say image component and this image component

00:42.580 --> 00:44.430
will just return.

00:44.440 --> 00:49.820
Let's see let's export before this is all before we forget.

00:56.860 --> 01:04.670
And we'll just export an image that I already actually grabbed.

01:04.710 --> 01:07.610
Let's make sure we close this

01:10.740 --> 01:18.790
and we're going to grab this chameleon image just because I think it looks nice save that.

01:19.080 --> 01:25.230
And in the last two about dodgiest page we're going to import it again nothing different here we've

01:25.230 --> 01:26.390
seen it before.

01:26.430 --> 01:32.550
You want to import the image from the folder again because it's outside of the pages folder we have

01:32.550 --> 01:40.440
to go one directory up two dots then slash and then go into the components folder and grab the image

01:41.220 --> 01:42.240
or image.

01:42.390 --> 01:48.630
And now we can hopefully import the image component.

01:48.680 --> 01:57.150
Let's save and go back to our example if I click on About Well I got the most beautiful website you've

01:57.150 --> 01:58.310
ever seen.

01:58.470 --> 02:01.100
I was a magician once by the Chameleon.

02:01.110 --> 02:02.340
Very cool.

02:02.340 --> 02:08.700
All right so we know these principles from react and everything is nice and simple.

02:08.760 --> 02:13.690
Let's get to a more complex topic in the next video by.
