WEBVTT

00:01.060 --> 00:02.500
Welcome back.

00:02.500 --> 00:05.390
Remember our task at the beginning of this section.

00:05.500 --> 00:13.600
I know we've gone through a lot of videos but if you remember all of this was for Bruno her boss he

00:13.600 --> 00:18.010
asked us to make the KCl Corp. Web site a little bit faster.

00:18.130 --> 00:21.390
And now we have some knowledge to do that.

00:21.430 --> 00:22.510
So let's go check it out.

00:24.520 --> 00:30.010
I have over here the Kaikohe Corp Web site and I'll link to this.

00:30.070 --> 00:33.330
And the project files after this video.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.620
Don't worry.

00:34.840 --> 00:40.030
Now looking at this web site I mean it looks pretty fine.

00:40.030 --> 00:42.800
It's got some cool animations.

00:42.910 --> 00:43.630
All right.

00:43.660 --> 00:44.310
Not bad.

00:44.320 --> 00:48.630
It's features some other products that they've created.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.720
Very nice.

00:50.710 --> 00:54.190
But let's put this Web site to the test.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.790
I have two web sites here for us that we're going to use.

00:56.830 --> 01:00.680
And they're really really important for performance testing.

01:00.730 --> 01:09.940
The first one is Page Speed insites by Google developers and we can enter a u r l and old do some speed

01:09.940 --> 01:11.070
tests for us.

01:11.260 --> 01:13.000
So I'm going to analyze that.

01:13.300 --> 01:17.090
And while that's working I'm also going to go to Web page test.

01:17.350 --> 01:25.610
Another great tool and I'm going to enter the Web site and the cool thing about this is that I can choose

01:25.850 --> 01:27.500
the test location and the device.

01:27.500 --> 01:31.010
Let's just say that we're going to use a.

01:31.040 --> 01:35.090
Yeah we'll just leave it with the default mobile view.

01:35.120 --> 01:39.660
And I'm going to say start test.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.110
Let's go back to page inside.

01:41.120 --> 01:49.060
While this is going on her right we're getting a couple of exclamation marks here which is never a good

01:49.060 --> 01:50.070
sign.

01:50.080 --> 01:54.750
It looks like it's displaying nicely on the mobile.

01:54.940 --> 02:02.080
But looking at this we have some optimizations that we can do we can eliminate Brandur and blocking

02:02.080 --> 02:07.260
javascript and see SS and optimize images.

02:07.390 --> 02:11.380
Caching is something that we'll cover later on in the course so we don't need to worry about it.

02:11.650 --> 02:18.150
But 75 out of 100 is not very good especially if Kaikohe Corp. wants to be a serious tech company.

02:18.460 --> 02:20.760
Let's look at the desktop.

02:20.930 --> 02:29.440
Even worse 65 out of 100 again Page Speed is awesome because Ill show you how to fix these issues and

02:29.440 --> 02:33.920
I'll show you what images can be compressed and all these other things that.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.520
Well we already know how to do that right.

02:36.610 --> 02:38.380
We've gone through it.

02:38.430 --> 02:42.800
Let's look at the web page test.

02:42.820 --> 02:44.230
All right.

02:44.470 --> 02:45.140
Not too bad.

02:45.150 --> 02:46.870
We're getting actually a couple of A's.

02:47.010 --> 02:50.830
Some BS on the compressed image again caching can be better.

02:51.880 --> 02:59.980
But looking at this web page gives us a lot of information that we can analyze and you can read for

02:59.980 --> 03:01.040
it yourself.

03:01.180 --> 03:04.830
We see that we can definitely improve a couple of things.

03:06.150 --> 03:08.610
So here's the challenge.

03:08.790 --> 03:10.660
Learning what you've learned.

03:11.040 --> 03:14.930
I wanted to take this Web site and try to improve it.

03:15.120 --> 03:18.020
The code for it is not very pretty.

03:18.760 --> 03:23.650
But we're not really worried about code right now we're worry about how can we improve the performance

03:23.650 --> 03:29.800
of this website using these two Web sites to help us out.

03:29.910 --> 03:30.950
Have a little challenge.

03:30.960 --> 03:35.940
And as a community we'll see who can build the fastest Web site.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.190
You're going to work on this.

03:37.220 --> 03:43.750
And then in the next video also give you what I would have done if I was working on this but I wanted

03:43.760 --> 03:49.120
to post your code and your results into the chat community that we have.

03:49.490 --> 03:56.380
And let's compare let's trade tips and tricks and let's see who can build the fastest Web site.

03:57.460 --> 03:59.420
I'll see in the next one by.
