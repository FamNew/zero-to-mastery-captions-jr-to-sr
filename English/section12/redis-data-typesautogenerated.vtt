Welcome back.

00:02.250 --> 00:08.990
Let's try a few more commands and then explain to you what datatype we've just been working on.

00:09.010 --> 00:17.930
So the first comment that we're going to add to our arsenal will be am set for multiple set.

00:18.040 --> 00:20.960
So in here now I can add multiple things.

00:20.980 --> 00:32.850
Let's say that I want a to be 2 and I want B to be 5 and I can keep attacking the month.

00:33.220 --> 00:44.010
Now I can just say get a get me and I've set multiple items in the database.

00:45.510 --> 00:52.130
I can also do multiple get and get both a and b just like that.

00:53.880 --> 00:54.600
All right.

00:54.630 --> 00:58.980
We just learned some basic rattus commands but you may have noticed something.

00:59.100 --> 01:04.450
The only datatype that we've been really working on are strings.

01:04.650 --> 01:09.850
Even if I set the number over here we see that it returns it as string.

01:10.110 --> 01:16.530
And we just learned the first datatype that rattus handles and that is a simple string.

01:16.790 --> 01:25.000
But there's actually a few more things that we can use and read is you see Berettas can handle five

01:25.090 --> 01:28.450
datatypes or five major datatypes.

01:28.660 --> 01:33.130
There's a few achcha others and things that they're adding on but the five main ones you're going to

01:33.130 --> 01:35.440
use are strengths.

01:35.440 --> 01:46.510
The next one is hashes Liszt's sets and sorted sets and we've just learned how to handle strings.

01:46.510 --> 01:50.190
But we need to learn how to handle the other datatypes as well.

01:51.270 --> 01:56.470
So let's cover those and the next upcoming videos I'll talk to you soon.

01:56.580 --> 01:58.240
See in the next one by.
