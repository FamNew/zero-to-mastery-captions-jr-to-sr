WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.590
Welcome back.

00:03.590 --> 00:11.530
Now just to recap there are three places where work needs to happen when displaying Web sites.

00:11.770 --> 00:16.750
The first well we obviously make a request to super fresh dotcom.

00:16.900 --> 00:23.380
So there's some work that goes there to transfer that request to the backend or the server and then

00:23.380 --> 00:30.490
the server does a bit of work there and maybe returns the email file finds it and returns it or maybe

00:30.490 --> 00:34.280
needs to talk to a database and retrieve some data there.

00:34.330 --> 00:39.120
We then have to send that information again through the wires.

00:39.310 --> 00:47.050
And then finally in our browser do some work so that we can display the page to the user and looking

00:47.050 --> 00:54.440
at this now we see that there are three foolproof ways to increase the speed of your website and applications

00:55.560 --> 00:59.940
and thereby improve customer satisfaction retention and conversion.

01:01.180 --> 01:05.760
You know things that make your boss employer business really really happy.

01:05.770 --> 01:11.180
So the first thing is you can improve what happens on the client side.

01:12.250 --> 01:18.550
The front end because the front end device needs time to render the page on the screen.

01:18.550 --> 01:20.100
The second thing we can improve.

01:20.290 --> 01:28.790
Well we can improve the transfer of our files over the wire network latency which is every request needs

01:28.790 --> 01:33.650
time to travel from client to the server and back to our network.

01:33.650 --> 01:37.310
Latency is the time it takes to do that transfer.

01:38.670 --> 01:44.460
And this becomes even more essential when we consider that an average web site makes more than 100 requests

01:44.760 --> 01:46.420
to load completely.

01:46.560 --> 01:49.250
Yes that number sounds ridiculous but its true.

01:50.030 --> 01:58.160
Finally the third is we can improve the processing done on the backend or back in processing the web

01:58.160 --> 02:05.750
server needs time to load data maybe from the database and maybe even assemble the website before it

02:05.750 --> 02:07.680
sends it over.

02:07.700 --> 02:13.460
Now for our website to be as fast as possible we can improve something in all three of these sections.

02:13.550 --> 02:14.850
So what can we do.

02:15.320 --> 02:22.640
Well before we jump into things I want to warn you there and find ways to optimize your website or your

02:22.640 --> 02:23.700
app.

02:23.720 --> 02:29.990
However one thing we want to keep in mind is that we want to think like a senior developer.

02:30.350 --> 02:31.290
What does that mean.

02:32.080 --> 02:39.130
It means you always focus on a problem and find a solution that solves that problem in the most efficient

02:39.580 --> 02:41.450
and valuable way.

02:41.620 --> 02:47.590
If you're optimizing your site but you don't even know what is slowing it down are you going to have

02:47.590 --> 02:54.430
comparison numbers or benchmarks to see if your optimizations have actually improved your speed.

02:54.910 --> 02:56.920
Well then you're just wasting your time.

02:58.010 --> 03:00.650
So this is where we're going to do in this course.

03:00.650 --> 03:06.980
We're going to focus on the big ticket items the main performance improvements that improve 90 percent

03:07.070 --> 03:08.390
of your web speed.

03:09.170 --> 03:13.700
Focus on this and you'll be far ahead of most people.

03:13.730 --> 03:15.880
Let's take a look at what we're going to learn.

03:16.770 --> 03:22.950
In this course we're going to cover all of these topics ranging from front end to back end and they

03:22.950 --> 03:27.430
have some cool little logos associated with them.

03:27.630 --> 03:34.020
And these are a lot but by the end of the course I promise you you're going to feel comfortable with

03:34.050 --> 03:38.420
each and every one of these and I'm going to show you how you can actually implement them in your code.

03:39.350 --> 03:47.120
However to start things off nice and easy for this section at least for part one of the performance

03:47.120 --> 03:56.620
section we're focusing on the transfer part as well as the critical render path.

03:56.780 --> 04:02.810
And then in part two of performance we will revisit and we'll talk about writing optimized code and

04:02.810 --> 04:04.420
progressive webapps.

04:04.430 --> 04:10.640
And then finally in part 3 we're going to cover some of the exciting things we can do on the backend

04:11.270 --> 04:14.080
to improve performance and scale.

04:14.160 --> 04:20.070
Like I said by the end of it this table will all make sense and you can call yourself a performance

04:20.070 --> 04:21.270
ninja.

04:21.270 --> 04:22.530
It's an exciting topic.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.300
I'm really excited to get into it.

04:25.180 --> 04:29.300
So let's start off with the network transfer section and the next video.

04:30.300 --> 04:31.890
See on that one Buh-Bye.
