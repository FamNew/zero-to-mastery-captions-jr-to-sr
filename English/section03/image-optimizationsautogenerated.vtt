00:01.600 --> 00:06.360
Welcome back and homeboy I just threw a bunch of text on the screen.

00:06.640 --> 00:07.390
Don't hate me.

00:07.390 --> 00:14.590
I did this so in the future you can pause the video when you revisit it and have a nice summary of why

00:14.590 --> 00:16.460
you need to do with images.

00:16.630 --> 00:19.010
But I'm going to give you the details now.

00:19.150 --> 00:21.000
Going one by one.

00:21.180 --> 00:26.190
So let's go through some of the points the first ones we've already covered right.

00:26.220 --> 00:30.680
If you want transparency you might want to use PLG if you want animations.

00:30.690 --> 00:35.910
Then use a gif if you want really colorful detailed images.

00:35.910 --> 00:38.110
Then you should probably use JPEG.

00:38.220 --> 00:40.220
Nice spelling there on my part.

00:40.770 --> 00:48.750
And if you want simple icons logos or illustrations that can scale well you can use as features.

00:48.780 --> 00:56.070
Now I talked about compressing some of these especially PNB and JPEG that tend to get pretty big and

00:56.070 --> 01:00.480
we can reduce the size of them without losing image quality.

01:00.480 --> 01:06.080
And our Web sites using some tools online and they're actually a ton of tools that you can use.

01:06.080 --> 01:09.180
These the ones are my favorites are going to show you how they work.

01:09.210 --> 01:10.560
So let's go through them.

01:11.540 --> 01:18.260
Let's use a large DNG file and make a small with tiny punji and then a large shape file and make it

01:18.260 --> 01:21.440
smaller with JPEG optimizer.

01:21.440 --> 01:24.620
Let's have a look.

01:24.760 --> 01:28.030
I have over here the two Web sites we're going to use again.

01:28.180 --> 01:32.950
You have online versions you have apps say you can download to do the sort of things.

01:32.950 --> 01:38.810
These are just my favorite and tried and tested really good tools and they're free.

01:39.540 --> 01:44.280
So with JPEG optimizer we can set the compression level.

01:44.670 --> 01:50.860
We can set the size of our of our image and we simply choose a file.

01:50.970 --> 01:55.780
I actually have two very large files that I've downloaded here.

01:55.800 --> 01:59.050
One's a pig and one is a piano.

01:59.370 --> 02:04.140
So for jpeg optimizer let's load this large image.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.490
I'm going to choose file

02:08.740 --> 02:14.460
and you can see over here that it's thirteen point two megabytes just absolutely massive.

02:14.460 --> 02:20.350
You definitely don't want to send that over the wire for a user especially if they're on their mobile

02:20.350 --> 02:20.940
phones.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.550
That's going to take forever to load.

02:23.520 --> 02:32.310
So I'm going to open that and just click optimized photo skin to do its work here because it is pretty

02:32.310 --> 02:32.920
large.

02:32.940 --> 02:36.180
In the meantime let's go to tiny PAGG.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.310
They have a nice little panda logo which I.

02:38.430 --> 02:39.420
I'm a big fan of.

02:39.650 --> 02:44.910
And you see over here they actually do JPEG files as well which is very misleading because their name

02:44.910 --> 02:54.340
is tiny PAGG looks like they're expanding anyway so let's drop a large PNB file here if I can drag and

02:54.340 --> 02:55.350
drop it in here.

02:55.390 --> 03:01.690
We see that it's 3.8 megabytes pretty big but tiny PNB is pretty fast.

03:01.690 --> 03:08.910
And look at that we've just minimized it by 1.1 megabytes without losing any quality.

03:09.250 --> 03:13.400
And we just saved 71 percent very very cool.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.350
How easy was that.

03:14.360 --> 03:18.110
I can just download the file now and use it in my web site.

03:18.190 --> 03:20.760
Let's see what the jpeg optimizer has been up to.

03:22.460 --> 03:23.280
All right.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.430
They have even bigger savings here.

03:25.500 --> 03:30.060
We have nine nine point nine percent savings as pretty insane.

03:30.300 --> 03:38.350
So we went from a massive 13 megabyte file size to just thirteen point five kilobytes.

03:38.470 --> 03:43.860
And if we're just displaying an image like this on a Web site you can see that it's still very clear.

03:43.930 --> 03:44.790
Very cool.

03:44.940 --> 03:47.440
So that's nice and easy right.

03:48.230 --> 03:53.290
Now let's go back to our list and see what else we have.

03:53.290 --> 03:57.860
All right so now we know how to use tiny PNB and JPEG optimizer.

03:57.880 --> 04:04.620
Let's look at the next point we want to try and choose simple illustrations over a highly detailed photographs.

04:04.780 --> 04:09.180
And that's pretty self-explanatory whenever you're building a website or a web app.

04:09.430 --> 04:12.350
Just be conscious of what images are you using.

04:12.370 --> 04:19.790
Do you really need that super detailed photo of your dog or can you just maybe use a nice dog icon instead.

04:21.710 --> 04:22.650
Let's go to the next one.

04:22.670 --> 04:30.170
Always lower JPEG image quality between 30 and 60 percent going to demonstrate how to do that very very

04:30.170 --> 04:30.950
easily.

04:32.450 --> 04:38.510
I have over here my large JPEG file again and remember it's 13 megabytes.

04:40.090 --> 04:42.100
Very very cool image.

04:42.100 --> 04:51.010
I can actually simply compress it without losing any quality by let's just duplicate this.

04:51.220 --> 04:58.690
And when I save I get a little bar here and you can do this with a lot of online tools and I can just

04:58.690 --> 04:59.410
change the quality.

04:59.410 --> 05:03.070
You can see that the file size right now is 4.2.

05:03.070 --> 05:09.850
If I do it all the way up it's 20 megabytes now and if I do it all the way down to about less than a

05:09.850 --> 05:17.880
megabyte if I save this all right there is the image and the quality seems still pretty much the same

05:17.880 --> 05:18.610
with the other one.

05:20.350 --> 05:23.550
So again always compress your images.

05:23.560 --> 05:27.690
There's other tools like image Optum that is also really really good.

05:27.700 --> 05:32.820
Like I said tons to choose from online.

05:32.830 --> 05:33.670
We're almost there.

05:33.670 --> 05:36.520
Let's look at resizing images based on size.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.230
It will be displayed.

05:38.770 --> 05:45.970
And this is self-explanatory but something that not a lot of people do and I see this mistake being

05:45.970 --> 05:47.620
made all the time.

05:48.040 --> 05:55.220
You want to start by matching up the images resolution to the size that is actually displayed on a website.

05:55.230 --> 06:00.600
So for example if you're displaying an image at only 500 pixels wide.

06:00.600 --> 06:08.070
Let's say your CSSA says that the width of the images 500 pixels then you don't need to keep that image

06:08.270 --> 06:11.050
to 1500 pixels.

06:11.130 --> 06:18.920
Chop it down to the actual size because an image with half the width will be even less than half the

06:18.920 --> 06:19.630
size.

06:20.870 --> 06:25.400
So make sure that you're actually using the size that's appropriate for you.

06:25.400 --> 06:32.530
You're never going to need something that's 5000 pixels wide and you can even adjust the size to make

06:32.530 --> 06:39.440
your images look sharp on higher definition displays like red now or for k but you really don't need

06:39.440 --> 06:40.920
to go any higher than that.

06:40.940 --> 06:43.380
So repeat after me.

06:43.590 --> 06:47.110
They're larger the resolution the larger the file size.

06:47.150 --> 06:49.510
So to keep them small.

06:49.540 --> 06:50.160
All right.

06:50.370 --> 06:55.550
For the last three over here we're going to take a break and cover them in the next video.

06:55.580 --> 06:59.940
So grab a coffee or tea and I'll see you in the next video.

07:00.140 --> 07:03.080
So don't leave me hanging I'll see in that one but by.
