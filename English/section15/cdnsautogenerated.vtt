00:01.110 --> 00:09.870
Let's talk about our first topic on the list content delivery networks or TDX and it's a topic we've

00:09.870 --> 00:18.360
covered slightly in the course it helps with accelerating almost any web site by caching its files in

00:18.360 --> 00:19.870
servers around the world.

00:21.040 --> 00:28.290
You see whether your visitors come from Europe Asia North America anywhere else.

00:28.510 --> 00:36.900
Content is automatically served from the nearest server for the fastest possible Spizz.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.500
And this diagram is from the CloudFlare web site probably the most popular CDN service in North America

00:45.450 --> 00:48.210
set up is extremely simple on their Web site.

00:48.210 --> 00:50.120
You don't need to do anything with code.

00:50.250 --> 00:55.740
You just go through their web page tell them what you need done and they do all the hard work for you.

00:57.240 --> 01:06.050
All you need to do is update your DNS name servers to use lawfare and it kicks in automatically.

01:06.060 --> 01:08.090
Now what does that mean.

01:08.400 --> 01:16.380
Well originally if this is our origin server that is our own server that we have all our files on and

01:16.380 --> 01:26.600
these CDN servers are owned by CloudFlare Well originally the request from one user lets say the users

01:26.600 --> 01:35.780
in Alaska when a user requests a web page the users request because we modify within KLOV for flare

01:35.780 --> 01:44.510
and tell it hey instead of coming directly to us to our origin server we modified our DNS configuration

01:44.750 --> 01:49.000
so that this user gets routed to CloudFlare servers.

01:49.220 --> 01:56.090
So they go to here upon initial request the edge server and this is what we call a CDN server sometimes

01:56.480 --> 02:06.780
makes a request to the origin server for the content the user requested and the origins server responds

02:07.050 --> 02:09.030
with the request.

02:09.260 --> 02:13.520
And then finally the server responds to the client.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.470
All right so that doesn't seem any faster does it.

02:17.340 --> 02:26.480
Well the value of a CDN is proximity to the client occurs after the initial request to the origin server.

02:26.540 --> 02:33.460
You see the first time around this server needs to get the files from the origin server.

02:33.490 --> 02:39.420
However it does something called caching where again we're going to cover in this section.

02:39.880 --> 02:48.420
After the initial request this data gets cached or remember'd onto the network of the Cdn so that each

02:48.420 --> 02:55.350
subsequent request from the client only needs to go as far as the nearest that's server that is here.

02:55.740 --> 03:02.220
So any more requests from this client is always going to go to this server and never have to worry about

03:02.220 --> 03:04.110
the origin server.

03:04.150 --> 03:06.370
Now why is this helpful.

03:06.510 --> 03:09.540
Well obviously it improves page load speed.

03:09.540 --> 03:12.690
There are also configure so it handles higher traffic loads.

03:13.050 --> 03:19.380
It can block spammers scrapers and other bad bots because while CloudFlare and other companies that

03:19.380 --> 03:25.230
offer this specialize in this so they dedicate a lot of time to their engineering team to fix these

03:25.230 --> 03:26.330
problems.

03:26.340 --> 03:33.660
It reduces your bandwidth consumption and sometimes they also do load balancing between multiple servers.

03:33.810 --> 03:37.950
Again load balancing is something that will cover in this section.

03:37.950 --> 03:41.010
Finally it is also very secure.

03:41.010 --> 03:44.440
Usually they allow you to send static files over a sheet.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.290
Yes.

03:45.300 --> 03:53.200
And also protect web sites from things like OS attacks or distributed denial of service attacks.

03:53.220 --> 03:55.700
So there's a lot of benefits to it.

03:56.220 --> 04:00.310
Now in this example I used CloudFlare but there's a lot of options out there.

04:01.300 --> 04:07.120
We have obviously CloudFlare and you can see how many servers they have around the world that based

04:07.120 --> 04:11.840
on where users are they can just connect to the closest server.

04:11.860 --> 04:20.880
There's also Amazon's popular cloud trunked and then Microsoft also has its own Microsoft Azure content

04:20.880 --> 04:22.090
delivery network.

04:22.380 --> 04:27.500
And there's a ton of other resources but these three are probably the most popular.

04:27.530 --> 04:28.760
Now let's go back to the diagram

04:31.490 --> 04:35.720
to understand why CDN ads are so popular and so widely used.

04:35.810 --> 04:41.970
We have to figure out what the problem is and the problem is something called latency.

04:42.320 --> 04:49.160
It's the annoying delay that occurs from the time that I hit enter to request a web page to actually

04:49.160 --> 04:52.140
getting the web page to load onto my browser.

04:53.830 --> 04:59.410
And that delay is affected by a number of factors and we've talked about it and the network optimization

04:59.500 --> 05:08.270
section in all cases though a big part of it is the delay by the physical distance between you and the

05:08.270 --> 05:10.890
Web sites hosting server.

05:11.070 --> 05:14.100
Let's use this diagram as an example.

05:14.890 --> 05:15.910
A request.

05:15.990 --> 05:20.640
Let's say I was in New York to Singapore a server that is in Singapore.

05:20.640 --> 05:29.360
Well that's a long long distance and a request doesn't necessarily go directly to Singapore.

05:29.490 --> 05:35.910
It most often hops from one router to another router to another hour until it gets all the way to Singapore

05:36.270 --> 05:39.180
and then finally they have to send those files back.

05:40.060 --> 05:48.870
Now it's pretty clear how CDN improves this latency by pulling static content files from the origin

05:48.870 --> 05:54.690
server and Singapore into a distributed CDN network and a process called caching.

05:55.020 --> 06:01.100
So that now if the server was just in Portugal the Cdn server was just in Portugal.

06:01.170 --> 06:03.220
We avoid all these extra hops.

06:04.410 --> 06:07.660
And this is a point that we don't really need to go any further in.

06:07.770 --> 06:14.010
It's pretty evident why CDN networks are valuable and you want to use companies that already have servers

06:14.010 --> 06:24.320
around the world like CloudFlare Amazon and Microsoft because they already have that speciality and

06:24.320 --> 06:28.940
they're fairly cheap to use and some offer free options like CloudFlare.

06:28.940 --> 06:30.960
So definitely give it a go.

06:31.010 --> 06:35.710
Any time you need to optimize delivering files to the front end.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.780
I'll see in the next one Buh-Bye.
