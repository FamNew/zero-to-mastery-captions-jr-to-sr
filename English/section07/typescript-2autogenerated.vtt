00:01.270 --> 00:02.260
Welcome back.

00:02.260 --> 00:08.890
We just wrote a few lines of typescript code but the one thing that was kind of annoying was that we

00:08.890 --> 00:12.710
had to constantly run this command to compile our code.

00:12.820 --> 00:17.760
Ideally we can just have that running and done automatically.

00:18.130 --> 00:20.470
And that way we can do that is quite simple.

00:20.470 --> 00:33.480
We can initialize our project as a typescript project by simply running TS C dash dash in it.

00:33.560 --> 00:37.570
We see that it's created a TS config based on file.

00:37.820 --> 00:48.250
If we go to this file we see that it's created what we call a configuration file for typescript and

00:48.340 --> 00:58.330
you can see over here that this file gives us a ton of option for the compiler to check and the compiler

00:58.360 --> 01:01.380
options can do many things.

01:01.390 --> 01:05.220
We see that our target is yes 5.

01:05.440 --> 01:11.140
And it says specify ECMAScript version and you can see how many defaults they have.

01:11.140 --> 01:15.910
So for example if I changed this to let's see there are options that they're giving us let's change

01:15.910 --> 01:18.180
it to E.S. 2017.

01:18.580 --> 01:22.040
So I'll say yes 20 17.

01:22.270 --> 01:25.620
What kind of modules we want to use we can do common gas.

01:25.720 --> 01:27.760
Or perhaps you want to do.

01:27.760 --> 01:32.770
Yes 2015 and a ton of options.

01:32.830 --> 01:40.510
You basically can decide what kind of work you want the compiler to do and what type of output we need.

01:40.600 --> 01:45.850
And the great thing about this config file is that it actually describes every little thing that you

01:45.850 --> 01:53.680
can do online you also have a great documentation on TS config file if you want to get really into it.

01:56.310 --> 02:03.060
But don't worry later on I'm going to show you how to actually simplify this step or how it's already

02:03.060 --> 02:04.950
been simplified for us.

02:04.950 --> 02:12.260
For now though we have a TS config file which is the default setup for now.

02:12.370 --> 02:18.650
If we go to typescript us so we just cleared our terminal.

02:18.780 --> 02:23.760
And the way we are able to run this and watch mode is quite simple.

02:23.760 --> 02:36.120
All we need not here all we need is TSC typescript dot TS and then dash dash watch for watch mode and

02:36.120 --> 02:41.770
you can see over here it's starting compilation Kham compilation is complete and now it's watching for

02:41.770 --> 02:42.580
changes.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.520
And every time I say if it's going to recompile and detect these changes.

02:48.790 --> 02:55.730
For example if I change this now to a boolean value it's going to give me an error.

02:55.860 --> 02:59.440
And the compiler says you're doing something wrong here.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.060
All right.

03:00.120 --> 03:03.540
So we have this running and everything set up.

03:03.600 --> 03:09.280
I think it's time for us to go through all the typeset typescript give us and do a bit of coding.

03:09.420 --> 03:14.880
So get that set up on your computer on your machine and I'll see in the next video by.
