00:03.460 --> 00:07.960
Listen the CEO has mentioned that he needs your help.

00:08.850 --> 00:12.330
He can see this company really taking off growing.

00:12.420 --> 00:19.170
Over the next couple of years and he has asked if you can prepare a plan of how our products are going

00:19.170 --> 00:25.680
to scale in the future and make sure that we can keep up with our plans and growth we want to make this

00:25.890 --> 00:27.470
company big.

00:27.480 --> 00:28.940
So can you help us out.

Oh boy.

00:39.650 --> 00:41.080
Here we go again.

00:41.300 --> 00:47.750
Let's finish off our performance section a section that has taken us quite a long time to get through

00:48.110 --> 00:50.950
because there's so many moving parts.

00:51.080 --> 00:58.190
We're going to learn some principles of how to scale and complete our overall picture so that we master

00:58.190 --> 01:05.030
performance optimizations and at the end of it we'll have a nice big picture vision of what we can do

01:05.150 --> 01:07.760
with any of our projects.

01:07.760 --> 01:08.330
Let's dive in.
