WEBVTT

00:01.160 --> 00:02.750
And welcome back.

00:02.750 --> 00:10.130
One thing I noticed from the previous video is in my Constans file I should make sure that my variable

00:10.130 --> 00:12.260
and my strings are the same.

00:12.260 --> 00:16.910
So just adding an underscore here are right.

00:16.940 --> 00:26.360
So let's talk about the next part which is using the other method that comes with reac redux which is

00:26.660 --> 00:27.200
connect

00:30.310 --> 00:39.170
now this connect function is optimized in order for us to avoid using something called store dots subscript.

00:39.310 --> 00:44.490
So if you remember when we canceled logged the store in our apt.

00:44.590 --> 00:50.960
Yes we had a few functions including the get state function that we locked.

00:50.960 --> 00:55.430
Now there's also a dot subscribe function which subscribes.

00:55.480 --> 01:02.510
Any component that is interested to be aware of redux and listen to any changes.

01:03.680 --> 01:10.400
But that's a little tedious and connect simplifies the process by simply saying use the connect function.

01:10.400 --> 01:17.220
And with that we're going to make the component redux aware.

01:17.430 --> 01:25.740
If you remember the Kinect components would be the yellow little components that know about redux.

01:25.740 --> 01:33.470
So we've created the provider component that essentially passes down the store to the components.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.180
But now we have to say which.

01:35.220 --> 01:45.870
Which one of these Riak components we want to be smart or be aware that the redox library exists and

01:45.870 --> 01:47.560
they can subscribe to changes.

01:47.580 --> 01:49.230
So I'm going to show you how to do that and this video

01:52.380 --> 01:59.040
and by the way this standard in the industry is that we call these smart components containers kind

01:59.040 --> 02:00.340
of like apt.

02:00.450 --> 02:01.310
Yes.

02:01.410 --> 02:08.080
So we're most likely going to connect the app digest file because it is a container.

02:08.210 --> 02:15.680
So the very first thing we're going to do is go to APT O.J.'s file and within here we want to import

02:15.740 --> 02:18.590
a few things.

02:18.620 --> 02:21.490
Let's start off with importing the actions.

02:21.530 --> 02:26.250
So I'm going to import the actions that we have.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.770
Let's go over here.

02:28.620 --> 02:32.300
We have the set search field action.

02:32.310 --> 02:41.210
So we're going to do the set search field action and we're going to import that from the actions that

02:41.210 --> 02:51.030
Jap's vah and because actions suggest fall is folder level up since the dodgiest is in the containers.

02:51.120 --> 02:56.740
I'm going to do the double periods.

02:56.850 --> 03:03.720
Let's save that and we get a nice little warning saying that sets are fields search field is defined

03:03.720 --> 03:04.800
but never used.

03:04.920 --> 03:11.330
That's also safe her index file perfect.

03:11.370 --> 03:16.120
Let's now use this connect method that I've been talking about.

03:16.140 --> 03:31.970
So now the top over here I'm going to say import the connect method from re-act redux and this connect

03:31.970 --> 03:32.540
method.

03:32.540 --> 03:33.570
The way it works.

03:33.590 --> 03:40.140
And again and you just have to get used to it is at the very bottom where we do export default.

03:40.710 --> 03:50.820
We're going to say connect is going to be a function and then another or another bracket's around app.

03:50.840 --> 03:58.550
Now this syntax might look a little bit confusing and connect to something we call higher order function

03:58.940 --> 04:09.130
in a higher order function is a function that returns another function so connect is going to run and

04:09.160 --> 04:15.500
whatever connect does inside of this function is going to return another function.

04:15.640 --> 04:22.250
And because it returns another function it's going to run this part with the app.

04:22.280 --> 04:28.190
So that's how higher order components work and you'll learn more about these later on in your career.

04:28.190 --> 04:35.330
But for now just know that this is the syntax you just have to get used to it and list out a newline

04:35.430 --> 04:36.560
so we can see it better here.

04:37.410 --> 04:47.250
Now within here connect accepts two parameters which again are standard I can name them whatever I want

04:47.470 --> 04:58.750
but we're just following the redux standards which the first one is map state to props and the second

04:58.750 --> 05:02.210
one is map dispatch.

05:02.880 --> 05:08.520
Two crops.

05:08.580 --> 05:09.100
All right.

05:09.100 --> 05:17.560
So right now we've just connected this component this app component and said hey subscribe to any state

05:17.560 --> 05:21.240
changes in the redux store.

05:22.090 --> 05:28.930
And now app knows that there is a redux store somewhere and any time that there's changes to it it might

05:28.930 --> 05:31.330
be interested in.

05:31.390 --> 05:35.470
But now we need to tell it what to be interested in.

05:35.500 --> 05:42.230
That is what state should I listen to one dispatch or what action should I listen to.

05:42.250 --> 05:46.820
So let's go back to the top and at the very top here.

05:46.910 --> 05:55.750
We want to define these functions that or these parameters to all we're going to do is say Konst map

05:55.840 --> 06:04.410
state to props and this is going to receive a state and oops.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.980
And it's going to return

06:09.850 --> 06:10.480
an object

06:13.730 --> 06:19.310
and like I said before you can name these whatever you want but this is the standard and any redox app

06:19.310 --> 06:22.040
you'll just see this or just get used to the syntax.

06:22.100 --> 06:25.340
Once you do it a couple times it becomes second nature.

06:25.340 --> 06:25.690
All right.

06:25.690 --> 06:30.950
And here we want to say that the search field

06:35.270 --> 06:41.690
state which again if we go to our reducers we have a search field over here

06:44.530 --> 06:53.260
this search field state is going to equal a state which we receive dot the part of the reducer which

06:53.260 --> 07:01.120
again if we go to reducers is search robots so search robots

07:05.330 --> 07:06.550
search field.

07:06.560 --> 07:13.580
So again it's saying that the search field that we're going to return which is going to be used as props

07:13.970 --> 07:24.560
by the hop component is going to come from the state not Stata state DOT search robots dot search field

07:25.010 --> 07:33.980
which again comes from our producer because remember in index our jazz file we've created the store

07:34.070 --> 07:37.220
with the search robots REDUCE-IT.

07:37.250 --> 07:45.980
So if we go back here let's save that and we have match dispatched to prop's is not defined.

07:46.160 --> 07:53.690
And again because we need the second part which is Matt dispatched to prop's So let's again create that

07:56.970 --> 08:07.700
will say that Konst map dispatched to prop's is going to receive something called dispatch.

08:07.830 --> 08:14.730
And again something that you'll just have to get used to dispatch if you remember in our discussion

08:14.730 --> 08:21.510
about flock's is what triggers the action so inaction is just an object that we've created.

08:21.510 --> 08:29.330
Again if you remember but in order to send this action we need something called dispatch still.

08:29.360 --> 08:35.250
So it gets dispatched into the reducer.

08:35.330 --> 08:44.750
So this dispatch can now be used to send actions and the way we do that we can say on search change

08:46.040 --> 08:48.350
which is just the name that I can say anything.

08:48.360 --> 08:51.950
So remember this is a prop that it's going to receive.

08:51.950 --> 08:58.230
But we're going to keep it the same as the one that we've had in our re-act app on search change.

08:58.260 --> 09:05.910
And so this is what the Propp is going to be named and the on search change is going to receive an event

09:06.390 --> 09:15.270
because remember it's a input box that users type and this event again because on search change is a

09:15.270 --> 09:26.840
function is going to dispatch the action set search field because remember the action is just an object

09:26.870 --> 09:28.870
just a function that returns an object.

09:28.940 --> 09:30.530
We want to dispatch that.

09:30.620 --> 09:39.950
So the producers are aware of it and this search field when it gets dispatched is going to listen to.

09:40.100 --> 09:47.590
If you remember in our actions it's going to receive a text that is whatever the user has and put it

09:48.220 --> 09:59.100
in which case we can just do event dot target dot value again just like we have in the on search change

09:59.100 --> 10:03.520
year event that target de-value.

10:03.530 --> 10:07.970
So if I save this let me make this a little bit smaller and save.

10:07.970 --> 10:11.390
Now I have a few little warnings.

10:11.390 --> 10:17.100
One is that remember we need to return this as an object.

10:17.180 --> 10:30.930
So we want to say return just like we did above with the state an object that contains all of our action.

10:30.950 --> 10:38.340
Again map state to prop's is tell me what state what piece state and I need to listen to and send us

10:38.350 --> 10:46.270
props and map dispatched to prop's says hey tell me what prop's I should listen to that are actions

10:46.300 --> 10:47.720
that need to get dispatched.

10:49.160 --> 10:52.170
All right everything is working.

10:52.670 --> 10:54.640
We're not getting any errors over here.

10:55.070 --> 11:01.520
And remember now that down here in the connect we know what map state to prop's is map dispatched to

11:01.530 --> 11:08.120
processes and connect is going to run the first part of the function and say Okay I'm listening to this

11:08.120 --> 11:15.950
part of the state and I'm interested in these actions and then it's going to give those props to the

11:16.010 --> 11:17.460
app.

11:17.480 --> 11:19.260
Here's the exciting part.

11:20.160 --> 11:24.850
Because remember I said redox can replace your state in your app.

11:24.990 --> 11:36.490
I can technically now remove the search field from this state from the app and I can also remove on

11:36.510 --> 11:40.290
search change because again that's coming down as props.

11:40.290 --> 11:45.860
We don't need to declare it as a method of app so I can delete that now.

11:46.760 --> 11:52.660
And then down here I'm not interested in this state search field anymore.

11:52.790 --> 11:56.780
I can remove that because now it's coming down as props.

11:56.990 --> 11:59.570
So instead I can say Konst

12:02.890 --> 12:16.180
search field with capital F comes from this stop props and finally the on search change doesn't come

12:16.180 --> 12:21.350
from this on search change which was a method of the app.

12:21.370 --> 12:22.520
It comes from the props.

12:22.600 --> 12:31.650
So again I can say on search change and remove the dot this let's say that

12:35.740 --> 12:42.040
and again I'll get an error saying that search field is not defined because remember with our redux

12:42.040 --> 12:47.730
state we changed the search field to have capital path.

12:47.750 --> 12:52.480
So if I changed that so it understands that that's what we're interested in.

12:53.860 --> 12:57.080
Everything is working.

12:57.110 --> 13:06.950
Now here's a little gotcha right now because in our index our last fall we only have one releaser.

13:06.980 --> 13:11.440
We're creating the store from this if we go back to APT.

13:11.490 --> 13:17.460
Yes state actually only has one field and that is search field.

13:17.570 --> 13:21.950
So we would have to do something like this.

13:22.830 --> 13:28.680
In order for it to work now we're going to get back to this point because once we start adding more

13:29.190 --> 13:37.080
peace of state and more reducers we're going to have to get state from each piece that we're interested

13:37.080 --> 13:37.470
in.

13:37.860 --> 13:42.510
But for now we're going to get back to that we're just going to say state search field because if you

13:42.510 --> 13:47.630
remember and Konsole dot log store don't get state.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.230
We just had the search field.

13:49.530 --> 13:54.730
So let's save that and go back.

13:54.750 --> 13:55.850
All right.

13:55.950 --> 13:58.160
Nothing in the console that's good.

13:58.230 --> 14:03.530
The moment of truth if I type something here.

14:03.610 --> 14:04.340
Look at that.

14:04.360 --> 14:11.140
Everything is working despite the fact that we no longer have the state for the search field in here

14:11.440 --> 14:13.910
or the method.

14:14.050 --> 14:16.570
Instead everything is going through redux.

14:16.570 --> 14:28.090
And just to test that theory if I go in here into my set search field and instead of having these automatic

14:28.090 --> 14:37.240
return I'm going to say console or log text and I'm going to return from here the object so we're just

14:37.240 --> 14:44.110
going to console log to see if the action is coming through.

14:44.140 --> 14:46.480
I save and go back.

14:46.480 --> 14:51.290
Let's open up the tool the console and look at that.

14:51.370 --> 14:55.890
Everything I type is being sent through the action.

14:55.900 --> 15:01.660
And another cool part is if I go to the reducer and again I test everything out and I say console dog

15:01.750 --> 15:11.340
log dot action type I save this and go back we see that we have a little funny action that happens.

15:11.340 --> 15:13.980
And this is the default when redox initiated.

15:14.100 --> 15:20.520
By now if I click on anything or type something I get change search real change search field because

15:20.520 --> 15:27.390
the reducer on every action gets run and says did change change search should action happen.

15:27.420 --> 15:29.960
If that's the case I'm going to return a new state.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.050
Very cool.

15:31.050 --> 15:37.820
We've just connected our react up to redox and everything works nicely.

15:38.850 --> 15:44.370
There's a bit of boilerplate here and you know you have to remember map state to prop's map dispatched

15:44.370 --> 15:53.040
to prop's but once you get used to that syntax it's really really nice and beautiful the way redox works

15:53.250 --> 16:01.710
and how we've cleaned up everything where everything flows nicely just like we mentioned we've created

16:01.710 --> 16:10.320
an interaction that gets dispatched into a reduce or a function that based on that action takes the

16:10.320 --> 16:13.710
state and changes it in the store.

16:13.710 --> 16:19.200
And because the store got updated re-act components that are interested are going to listen to those

16:19.200 --> 16:22.040
changes and make a change.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.260
Very cool.

16:25.260 --> 16:28.430
All right some more exciting stuff coming up in the next video.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.080
I'll see on that one.

16:30.080 --> 16:30.390
Bye bye.
