The more time passes the more code we'll have out there on the Internet.

00:09.130 --> 00:16.800
It is often easy to keep adding libraries and third party code into our projects again as more time

00:16.800 --> 00:22.590
passes more people have to write code and the same problems keep coming up.

00:22.590 --> 00:29.130
So people write libraries and put them up on Antron to make our lives easier so that we don't have to

00:29.130 --> 00:30.760
keep reinventing the wheel.

00:31.830 --> 00:39.990
However next time you just do NPM install and add a new library I want to stop and say to yourself why

00:40.020 --> 00:41.910
do I need this library.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.850
Will it really help me out by adding value.

00:46.250 --> 00:51.520
And is the size of the library and the extra abstractions worth it.

00:53.130 --> 00:59.730
This is a big problem especially in the reactor ecosystem because in re-act land is all about adding

00:59.730 --> 01:01.320
functionality that you want.

01:01.320 --> 01:07.850
On top of react we added redux we added testing with geste and so on and so on.

01:08.430 --> 01:15.480
I have seen many projects keep adding tools and libraries and bloating their project with third party

01:15.570 --> 01:17.760
libraries.

01:17.910 --> 01:23.390
Now instead of just NPM installing a new library because it's so easy to do.

01:23.730 --> 01:31.050
Make sure that each thing you add to your project is assessed as a team and ask your team.

01:31.140 --> 01:33.000
Do we really need it.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.620
How big is the library.

01:34.620 --> 01:37.820
And is the size of this library really worth it.

01:37.830 --> 01:41.180
Will it actually increase the value of the project.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.800
Now keep this in mind.

01:42.900 --> 01:46.900
A project is just like a childhood room.

01:46.920 --> 01:53.670
Sure it's easy to keep adding trophies and toys and things to your room to make the child happy.

01:54.310 --> 01:59.420
But eventually it's going to be cluttered and you may need to clean it up one day.

01:59.480 --> 02:05.220
Sure adding things to this room is easy but cleaning things is always harder.

02:05.270 --> 02:10.330
Make sure that the things you add to the project are worth it and meaningful to you.
