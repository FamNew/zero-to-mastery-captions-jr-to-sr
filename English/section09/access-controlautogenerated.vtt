00:02.870 --> 00:03.670
Welcome back.

00:03.680 --> 00:05.810
We're getting closer and closer to the end.

00:05.960 --> 00:07.830
Let's talk about access control.

00:08.990 --> 00:17.310
Access control is having restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do or not.

00:18.610 --> 00:23.260
So this is something that happens after you're giving authentication.

00:23.260 --> 00:30.340
That is we know the user but what do they have access to see attackers can exploit these flaws to access

00:30.400 --> 00:39.450
unauthorized functionality data and other access points that can see users accounts views sensitive

00:39.450 --> 00:42.350
files maybe even modify user data.

00:42.720 --> 00:50.760
So you want to make sure that the access control or access rights are in check for your project.

00:51.880 --> 00:59.440
Now with access control the main idea is this principle of least privilege you're going to hear this

00:59.440 --> 01:00.240
everywhere.

01:00.280 --> 01:07.700
Always give the least amount of privilege possible give only enough that people can do their work.

01:08.490 --> 01:14.400
And a great example of this is something that we've actually already done.

01:14.440 --> 01:20.590
If you remember in our security service that we've been working on I know it's a little bit messy so

01:20.590 --> 01:22.830
let's just clean it up for now.

01:22.980 --> 01:30.080
We're going to remove this and remember the course that I said we're going to get back to him we're

01:30.080 --> 01:39.670
going to talk about well Corps is very important for security and especially access control.

01:39.680 --> 01:42.460
Let's show you what happens when we don't use course.

01:42.500 --> 01:50.210
So I'm going to comment this out I'm going to save and then go back to our make me secure playground

01:50.220 --> 01:56.780
over here and let's type something I'm typing something and then let's look at the console as I submit.

01:58.040 --> 02:06.380
Oh we get some errors saying that pass access control no access control allow origin.

02:06.410 --> 02:07.380
What does that mean.

02:07.420 --> 02:09.040
Says set request motu.

02:09.050 --> 02:12.360
No course to Fessor resources.

02:12.380 --> 02:13.450
All right.

02:13.470 --> 02:18.070
Core's stands for cross origin resource sharing.

02:18.380 --> 02:23.020
I know all these names don't really make sense of the beginning but let me simplified that.

02:23.120 --> 02:30.520
All it saying is I need to have I don't have access for you to access the server.

02:30.680 --> 02:40.730
You see if we just created servers like this and just left it without cause well then anybody can access

02:40.730 --> 02:41.260
them.

02:41.360 --> 02:48.170
Maybe this server is only meant to be by myself for my special purposes but if I have random people

02:48.170 --> 02:56.030
accessing the server utilizing the machine and using up resources that could cost me a lot of money

02:56.450 --> 03:02.380
and for security reason we don't want to just give access to anybody to to these endpoints.

03:02.420 --> 03:07.100
I mean even just for this entire server may maybe this secret endpoint.

03:07.130 --> 03:15.690
We only want a certain domain or a certain website to actually be able to send secrets.

03:15.920 --> 03:19.900
We don't want bad people to just be able to send secrets.

03:19.910 --> 03:30.770
We do this by adding course and by adding cores I'm saying yeah yeah just let's let's this cross origin

03:30.770 --> 03:31.970
resource sharing happen.

03:31.970 --> 03:33.150
I don't mind at all.

03:33.440 --> 03:34.760
And if I refresh your

03:37.590 --> 03:45.000
and I sense something all right it's working fine that's great but that's not really good.

03:45.060 --> 03:51.210
I mean we want the principle of least privilege that is we want to get the least amount of access to

03:51.210 --> 03:56.220
make our apps work and in our case we don't want to just give access to everybody.

03:56.370 --> 04:01.160
We want to give access to only people that we trust.

04:01.230 --> 04:03.520
So cores in their documentation.

04:03.780 --> 04:10.140
If you go to their NPM package actually has some really really good documentation and code snippets

04:10.140 --> 04:10.980
that you can use.

04:11.310 --> 04:13.030
But let me show you one of them.

04:14.280 --> 04:21.260
If I copy and paste this from their documentation they essentially have something called core's options

04:21.640 --> 04:26.860
and these are just options that we give that we check this wireless.

04:26.860 --> 04:34.910
That is a good list of domains out we're giving access to hit our endpoints in our server and cores

04:34.910 --> 04:41.780
option just has an origin function that checks this wide list and all we need to do is add this core's

04:41.780 --> 04:44.760
options as a parameter.

04:45.020 --> 04:56.450
So now if I save this and go back to my Web site let's refresh and I type something oh no no no no you're

04:56.450 --> 05:00.230
not of those Web sites that we waitlisted we're not gonna let you in.

05:01.180 --> 05:01.820
Awesome.

05:02.110 --> 05:04.830
So let's give the access just to us.

05:05.050 --> 05:11.530
Right now I just have it locally running as you can see on my file but on get help over here which you

05:11.530 --> 05:12.790
have access to as well.

05:12.920 --> 05:17.500
I've put it up on get her pages so I have a nice yourself.

05:17.680 --> 05:21.960
So let's say that we want my I negotiate.

05:22.160 --> 05:22.950
Dodd get hard.

05:22.970 --> 05:26.550
I go to have access so that we can send information.

05:26.830 --> 05:31.670
Well let's open up the console to test the case where we don't have permission.

05:32.180 --> 05:33.740
Yep we get better.

05:34.150 --> 05:38.710
And let's add this to the white list.

05:38.720 --> 05:39.500
All right.

05:39.500 --> 05:42.300
I'm saving this and going back.

05:42.320 --> 05:45.490
Let's refresh just have a clean slate.

05:45.510 --> 05:47.590
I'm going to type something.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.620
Boom we have access.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.960
No issues here.

05:50.980 --> 05:52.170
You've actually received.

05:52.180 --> 05:53.000
Look at that.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.560
We've actually received this user input.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.270
Very very cool.

05:58.280 --> 06:06.890
Now this is one principle in access control but it can apply to anything to administrator privileges

06:06.890 --> 06:09.970
to database access to anything.

06:09.980 --> 06:15.080
The main idea is this one line principle of least privilege.

06:15.290 --> 06:21.060
Never give more privilege than you need to only just the right amount.

06:21.220 --> 06:25.180
So that way we give less attack points to bad people.

06:27.300 --> 06:27.820
All right.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.060
That's it for now.

06:29.070 --> 06:30.690
See you in the next one by.
