00:01.710 --> 00:02.710
Walk them back.

00:02.970 --> 00:10.770
Let's talk about the second point of making a progressive webapp and probably the cutest little icon

00:10.920 --> 00:13.620
that I'm going to have in this course.

00:13.620 --> 00:23.060
The app manifest now for a progressive Web app to behave like a native app we need to mimic not just

00:23.270 --> 00:32.660
the function of a native app but also some of the views that we get with it or the shell for example

00:32.660 --> 00:33.740
on your phone.

00:33.740 --> 00:40.760
You can download an app and have an app icon on Android devices you have things such as splash screens.

00:40.940 --> 00:49.100
The idea is to make the web app as indistinguishable as possible to a real mobile app.

00:50.600 --> 00:55.000
And we can do that with the app manifest before we get into it.

00:55.040 --> 01:03.890
The one thing I do want to point is that a lot of people forget to include in their index start a shemale

01:03.890 --> 01:10.430
file this line over here and this comes out of the box with create react up he can see that I'm in the

01:10.430 --> 01:19.370
public index that a folder and this line which is the meta tag with viewport optimizes the app for multiple

01:19.370 --> 01:20.350
devices.

01:20.690 --> 01:25.510
And this might seem super obvious but a lot of people forget it.

01:25.580 --> 01:32.850
And this line helps with adjusting the screen size based on the device.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.060
So this is a must.

01:35.080 --> 01:40.200
And it will warn you if you're missing this line and the lighthouse report.

01:40.340 --> 01:45.110
So now that we have the screen set up for mobile devices.

01:45.110 --> 01:47.360
Let's talk about the app manifest.

01:47.570 --> 01:54.770
And as you can see in our public folder again this is something that we get for free from create reactor

01:56.150 --> 01:57.710
and this is it.

01:57.740 --> 02:01.430
This is the manifest dodgiest on file.

02:01.480 --> 02:07.540
It's a simple Jaisalmer filed that gives the developers the ability to control how the app should appear

02:07.990 --> 02:15.670
to the user in areas where they would expect to see apps such as the mobile device homescreen.

02:15.910 --> 02:21.610
And just define how the app is going to launch and how it's going to look.

02:21.610 --> 02:29.530
So if you remember in my example over here with this hacker news app we had the ad to homescreen button

02:29.800 --> 02:36.410
in the application tab and you might have noticed that we actually clicked on this thing called manifest

02:36.620 --> 02:46.710
and the application and that's the manifest dot Jasonville the browser reads this and spits out this

02:46.710 --> 02:49.380
little piece of information for us.

02:49.500 --> 02:58.150
And if I scroll down you see that I have icons here that to get downloaded just like I did for when

02:58.150 --> 03:00.880
I downloaded it onto my home screen.

03:01.450 --> 03:06.690
And this is the icon that you'll see when you download this app on your mobile phone.

03:07.060 --> 03:13.820
And it also gives us this nice little feature to add to homescreen.

03:13.870 --> 03:17.350
So this is the app manifest file and what it does.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.410
Now how do we generate these icons.

03:21.460 --> 03:31.330
We see over here that create re-act app has generated a feather on in the public folder but we're missing

03:31.420 --> 03:33.030
a few things aren't we.

03:33.070 --> 03:40.150
We don't have all these other sized icons for mobile phones because we still need to generate them for

03:40.150 --> 03:48.160
our app and we can see here that they have different sizes based on whichever device this gets downloaded

03:48.160 --> 03:48.590
on.

03:50.050 --> 03:55.290
Luckily for us there's a great tool that does this very nicely and easily.

03:55.340 --> 03:59.040
It's called real con generator.

04:00.640 --> 04:10.940
And this all we need to do is provide an image such as an image of a robot by just clicking on select

04:11.480 --> 04:16.230
Fab.com picture and it will take you through the steps to download these.

04:16.610 --> 04:23.600
And all we need to do is include them in our public folder just like the Fabrikant icon laws and reference

04:23.600 --> 04:27.970
them in the manifest dot Jaisalmer the end door.

04:27.980 --> 04:35.240
This is exactly where we're going to do in our exercise to turn our robot friends up into a progressive

04:35.320 --> 04:36.440
Web app.

04:36.470 --> 04:46.160
Another thing that this web site does for us is previewing and customizing the splash screen for our

04:46.160 --> 04:48.100
manifest file.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.210
Now what is a splash screen.

04:51.580 --> 04:58.990
In older versions of chrome for Android tapping on the home screen icon for an app would often take

04:58.990 --> 05:04.700
up to a couple of hundred milli seconds before that screen gets loaded.

05:04.750 --> 05:11.990
A user would see a white screen which makes the experience a little bit jarring.

05:11.990 --> 05:15.560
And it looks like the Web site is loading really slow.

05:15.980 --> 05:23.930
So chrome 47 and above support this idea of a splash screen where you can add a background color when

05:23.930 --> 05:26.440
you tap on the app.

05:26.480 --> 05:32.240
The progressive Web app instead of loading the white screen it's going to load something called a splash

05:32.240 --> 05:32.790
screen.

05:33.570 --> 05:40.620
Where will have the background color the name and icon of the web and you will get that all from our

05:40.710 --> 05:42.870
manifest God Jaisalmer.

05:43.320 --> 05:50.320
And this is all done simply to make your web app feel a lot closer to what you see with native apps.

05:50.460 --> 05:55.860
When you click on native apps even if they're loading they have some sort of a background and icon to

05:55.860 --> 06:00.100
show you that it is loading over although that's it.

06:00.100 --> 06:01.510
That's pretty simple right.

06:01.510 --> 06:05.600
All we need is some icons and add them to manifest.

06:05.630 --> 06:08.390
Got JS on R-Pa.

06:08.420 --> 06:09.490
That's it for now.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.080
I'll see in the next one.

06:11.210 --> 06:11.530
Bye bye.
