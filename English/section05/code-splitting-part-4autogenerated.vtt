Welcome back.

00:03.430 --> 00:08.720
I wanted to add a quick note about code splitting when it comes to code splitting.

00:08.740 --> 00:11.270
There's a couple of options.

00:11.350 --> 00:18.360
There's something called rote based Chungking or splitting up the javascript files based on the routes.

00:18.370 --> 00:24.500
Kind of like we did and the example and this is a really really good way to go about it.

00:24.520 --> 00:27.380
Most of the time this is why you want to do.

00:27.600 --> 00:36.020
But there's also a thing called component based Chongqing where you're able to code split not just at

00:36.040 --> 00:39.560
the road level but on a component level.

00:39.560 --> 00:42.070
Now when would you want to do that.

00:42.070 --> 00:48.910
For example if your home page gets really really really really big maybe you don't necessarily want

00:48.910 --> 00:50.300
to load up all the javascript.

00:50.380 --> 00:56.890
Maybe you have a little sidebar here where you click and a menu bar appears.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.320
Maybe we don't want that loaded.

00:59.680 --> 01:07.980
In that case you can have component level code splitting where you remove the javascript for this side

01:08.070 --> 01:15.510
menu bar and only activate it when a user clicks on the button and because the javascript for that should

01:15.510 --> 01:22.580
be small it should load fairly fast so as your apps get bigger and bigger you want to think about Rob

01:22.640 --> 01:28.100
base code splitting and also component based code splitting whatever fits your need.

01:28.100 --> 01:30.520
Every project is different by you want to think about that.

01:31.300 --> 01:39.320
Finally re-act has a really good documentation on code splitting and how to do it.

01:39.550 --> 01:46.330
And they even show you a great way to do code splitting with re-act router which again you can use for

01:46.330 --> 01:51.670
code splitting and something called re-act loadable which is a great library for you to do.

01:51.670 --> 01:52.420
Code splitting.

01:52.680 --> 01:59.870
I like their tag line over here but Riak loadable makes it really really easy to do code splitting so

01:59.870 --> 02:03.690
that you don't even have to implement that async component like we did.

02:05.060 --> 02:11.670
I highly recommend you check out them as well as re-act router and the documentation on the re-act Web

02:11.670 --> 02:12.560
site.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.050
There are many ways to do it.

02:14.150 --> 02:20.410
In the end the idea is the same how can we ship the least amount of javascript to the user.

02:20.420 --> 02:23.740
All right if you want to go ahead definitely check this out.

02:23.740 --> 02:28.150
Otherwise it's off to the next video Alcyone that one by.
