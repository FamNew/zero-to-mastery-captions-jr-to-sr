00:01.420 --> 00:05.020
So we may know how to use SSH now.

00:05.170 --> 00:10.520
But to truly understand a topic we must know how it works.

00:10.870 --> 00:16.990
And in this video and the few others after this we're going to talk about the encryption techniques

00:17.290 --> 00:24.140
used in SSH to see how we were able to do the things we do with SSH.

00:24.430 --> 00:26.570
Now a bit of a warning here.

00:26.740 --> 00:33.100
This topic can get pretty complex and you may have to revisit these videos later.

00:33.130 --> 00:34.980
However stick with it.

00:35.320 --> 00:41.260
And by the end of this section you'll feel comfortable with SSH and how it works and you'll never have

00:41.260 --> 00:42.670
to worry about it again.

00:42.670 --> 00:43.550
So hang in there.

00:44.530 --> 00:55.150
Now there are three techniques used in SSH, first, symmetrical encryption second, asymmetrical encryption.

00:55.150 --> 01:04.620
And then finally hashing, and although a little complex as I said before I am teaching this because these

01:04.620 --> 01:12.030
come up whenever using HTTPS, if you're working with block chains and so many other parts of programming

01:12.630 --> 01:16.260
and it's something that it's really good to know as you develop into your career.

01:16.380 --> 01:21.960
So one by one, and the next sections we're going to go through them and I'm going to show you exactly

01:21.960 --> 01:23.560
how they work.

01:23.670 --> 01:27.630
And SSH I'll see in the next one. Buh-Bye.
