WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:02.680
Welcome back.

00:02.850 --> 00:06.490
It's time to finish up this progressive webapp part.

00:06.750 --> 00:13.950
If we scroll down here we see that because of create react up we're getting all these benefits of a

00:13.950 --> 00:14.360
should.

00:14.380 --> 00:23.720
Yes we have service workers registered and we have some great caching happening with service workers.

00:23.850 --> 00:33.580
So let's double check that if we open up this app and go to our developer tools go to applications we

00:33.580 --> 00:38.990
can go into our cache storage

00:41.860 --> 00:47.110
and in the cache stores we see the S-W precast in here.

00:47.140 --> 00:53.840
We see what we are caching a CSX.

00:53.930 --> 01:05.060
We have some javascript and some funds that were caching perhaps over here we can add the sound file

01:05.630 --> 01:13.910
of all the robots and if we scroll up to the service workers we see that there is a service worker that

01:13.910 --> 01:21.390
is activated and running and it shows when it started.

01:21.650 --> 01:24.790
And you can even click on register if you want.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.620
Now the one thing that's missing though is the

01:30.510 --> 01:33.080
we don't have that much in the manifest file.

01:33.090 --> 01:42.130
We have some default from create re-act app but we have this Generica icon and it's kind of empty.

01:42.360 --> 01:50.560
And if we go into our report we see that it's complaining that the manifest does not have icons that

01:50.560 --> 01:55.140
are at least 192 pixels and 5 12 pixels.

01:55.180 --> 01:57.390
So let's go ahead and do that.

01:57.460 --> 02:06.920
If you remember we have the father on generator and in here we can just select a picture a screen capture

02:06.920 --> 02:12.460
that just took of one of our robots.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.650
It's going to generate for us everything that we need.

02:16.160 --> 02:20.150
I could have done a better job in making sure that my image is a square.

02:20.360 --> 02:24.990
But for now we can just continue with this picture and they'll do everything for you.

02:27.200 --> 02:31.580
As you can see here they have all the settings for us that we can use for.

02:31.580 --> 02:37.790
We can see what's going to look like we can see what it is going to look like on Android and also on

02:38.030 --> 02:39.020
Windows.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.560
Very very cool.

02:40.670 --> 02:48.150
And we can customize the look of our app so we can just click generate

02:51.200 --> 02:55.680
and this might take a bit of time depending on your internet connection.

02:55.880 --> 02:59.540
But hopefully by the end of it we have everything we need.

02:59.560 --> 03:03.190
First let's download our package.

03:03.210 --> 03:13.370
Let's open this up and we have a great set of icons that we can use.

03:13.580 --> 03:15.810
And we have nice steps laid out for us.

03:16.650 --> 03:22.180
So we want to extract this back kitchen the root of our Web site let's go ahead and do that.

03:22.280 --> 03:27.820
We're going to move the package that we just downloaded or we're going to put all the files that we

03:27.820 --> 03:38.640
just used in the public folder up let's copy paste here and we're going to replace the Fabrikant

03:41.730 --> 03:46.190
and the third step is to insert the following code in the section of your page.

03:46.260 --> 03:56.840
So let's just copy and paste this go to index Dodd G-S or index dot HMO and we can just

04:00.210 --> 04:04.730
this code and let's save this again.

04:04.790 --> 04:08.630
We're going to run NPM non-capital MBM run deploy

04:12.200 --> 04:16.700
and we're going to have to wait a little bit to make sure that our changes propagate and then we're

04:16.700 --> 04:18.710
going to test on Lighthouse.

04:19.100 --> 04:25.900
But also looking at this I don't see the sizing that the lighthouse report gave us.

04:26.090 --> 04:33.880
If you remember they wanted an icon with size 1 2 and 5 12 pixels.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.380
Let's go ahead and have those.

04:36.470 --> 04:43.930
Now the other thing we want to do is go into the manifest adjacent file and this is where we had the

04:43.930 --> 04:51.960
icons and we see that the sizes of 192 and 5:12 that the lighthouse report complained about is not here

04:51.970 --> 04:54.100
so let's just add those

04:57.410 --> 05:04.200
and we'll say that we want this one the Android Chrome one to buy 192.

05:04.550 --> 05:18.180
So we'll say Android Chrome one I need to buy one or two sizes is going to be one way to buy a 192 and

05:18.180 --> 05:26.520
the type is going to be Image TNG because well that's what it is.

05:27.470 --> 05:30.470
And that should be TNG as well.

05:33.170 --> 05:42.000
And then you see here that we don't have the size 512 that we generated.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.700
So let's just say that it will use this one instead.

05:47.410 --> 05:56.770
There's something that you can just manually do this yourself was well let's just say 384 by 384 picture.

05:58.400 --> 06:05.240
One display as well because we're going to say that the size is going to be five 12 by 12.

06:05.400 --> 06:09.660
But you can modify this and create this that matches the size properly.

06:10.220 --> 06:16.020
Let's save and then run NPM run deploy.

06:16.030 --> 06:16.470
All right.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.630
Looks like it's published.

06:18.970 --> 06:25.230
Let's just go back now to our re-act up and we can go back to our Web site.

06:25.240 --> 06:27.610
We see that our private con is updated.

06:27.610 --> 06:29.760
It doesn't have this re-act logo anymore.

06:30.010 --> 06:39.470
And if we open up the application folder and let's refresh what we have a syntax error and looks like

06:39.470 --> 06:43.680
in our manifest file we made a little mistake and line 10.

06:43.820 --> 06:52.840
We should have added a comma and by the way to show you that it does work if I do NPM start and just

06:52.840 --> 06:54.040
test locally

06:57.450 --> 06:59.430
but can see that we have the new icon.

06:59.520 --> 07:08.230
If I open the application folder manifest we have the add to homescreen button that on mobile will pop

07:08.230 --> 07:15.590
up if the user visit the website multiple times and I can even do this on my laptop as well.

07:16.430 --> 07:21.580
And if we scroll down we see our images.

07:21.630 --> 07:28.550
So if we deploy it should all work.

07:28.590 --> 07:30.740
All right let's check it out.

07:31.600 --> 07:38.150
If I go to the application and refresh if we scroll down.

07:38.150 --> 07:42.580
All right we see our icons 192 and 512.

07:42.810 --> 07:49.890
I even have the add to home screen button and this home screen button will obviously appear on our mobile

07:49.890 --> 07:56.450
device if we're using the website a lot but also over here at the site to your laptop.

07:56.460 --> 07:58.320
But I don't really want to do that.

07:59.590 --> 08:03.480
Let's submit this to Lighthouse and see what happens.

08:04.420 --> 08:09.610
And again I keep reminding you this sometimes when you deploy it takes a long time.

08:09.610 --> 08:11.980
The best way to check is if you go to your get hub

08:18.280 --> 08:26.380
and we can go to whichever repository you're using and if you go to your branch get help pages you can

08:26.380 --> 08:28.930
see what you're deploying.

08:28.930 --> 08:35.010
In our case you can see that we have index studies Shamal with our images.

08:35.020 --> 08:36.240
If I go to asset.

08:36.270 --> 08:38.150
Oh no not this one.

08:38.260 --> 08:42.350
If I go back and go to dot manifests if I can find it.

08:44.210 --> 08:44.980
Oh there you go.

08:45.070 --> 08:46.480
Manifested Jaison.

08:46.530 --> 08:50.720
I see that everything's been updated here all right.

08:50.720 --> 08:59.190
Moment of truth if I go close this and do lighthouse lab generate report.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.110
Wish me luck.

09:06.110 --> 09:07.850
Oh yeah look at that.

09:07.900 --> 09:10.730
100 100 100 100.

09:10.820 --> 09:12.800
This performance could be improved.

09:12.800 --> 09:15.800
Again this is because of my internet connection.

09:16.010 --> 09:17.170
It's not too too bad.

09:17.210 --> 09:21.290
But these are things that we can easily optimize.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.070
How cool is that though.

09:23.120 --> 09:26.190
That was pretty easy to implement a progressive Web app.

09:26.270 --> 09:26.790
Right.

09:26.870 --> 09:35.640
Just a little bit of work a day's work and you can have your app be a lot closer to mobile apps.

09:35.930 --> 09:42.230
Now as you know having a progressive Web app is a lot more than just loading a couple of images but

09:42.230 --> 09:47.600
it's nice to know that create re-act app takes care of it for us so that we can worry on performance

09:47.600 --> 09:53.430
improvements accessibility and other best practices.

09:53.430 --> 09:56.030
For now though we worked hard.

09:56.280 --> 10:00.890
Go ahead and start playing around with the app see what else you can improve.

10:01.170 --> 10:05.560
But ladies and gentlemen we've got ourselves a progressive Web site.

10:06.060 --> 10:07.980
I'll see in the next one by.
