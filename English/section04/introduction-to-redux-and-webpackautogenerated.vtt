00:01.780 --> 00:03.190
Welcome back.

00:03.190 --> 00:08.920
Looking back at how we can make our apps better from the previous section you remember the critical

00:08.920 --> 00:11.010
render path.

00:11.210 --> 00:16.550
You can see that there are two main bottlenecks for javascript right over here.

00:16.550 --> 00:22.650
Number three and right over here and number eight and four.

00:22.730 --> 00:32.060
One is to minimize DOM manipulation through javascript and the other is javascript delivery how we deliver

00:32.060 --> 00:34.250
our javascript to the content.

00:34.280 --> 00:40.640
Now in this section as I said we'll go over how to build a simple re-act up with this diagram things

00:40.640 --> 00:41.740
make sense right.

00:41.750 --> 00:48.280
The better our delivery of javascript Well the faster we're going to build the render tree.

00:48.350 --> 00:55.100
And we also want to be smart about how much real rendering we're going to do because any time javascript

00:55.160 --> 01:00.770
changes something in the DOM we have to go through this step again into the rendered tree layout and

01:00.770 --> 01:02.120
paint.

01:02.120 --> 01:09.810
So if we can solve these two bottlenecks with something like re-act That's pretty good right.

01:09.950 --> 01:11.440
And that's what we're going to do.

01:11.540 --> 01:19.040
We have react to really help us out with this cycle of rendering layout paint and then modifying rendering

01:19.070 --> 01:21.610
layout paint.

01:21.670 --> 01:29.200
We're also going to learn a little bit about Westpac which help us with javascript delivery to optimize

01:29.200 --> 01:30.120
that.

01:30.310 --> 01:38.860
And then finally we're going to talk about redux and how redux adds a little bit to react to allow us

01:39.700 --> 01:40.290
to improve.

01:40.300 --> 01:47.440
Again this process of change something random tree layout paint change something Redner tree layout

01:47.830 --> 01:50.190
paint.

01:50.220 --> 01:51.590
So remember our challenge

01:54.170 --> 02:00.620
Kaikohe Corp. has the rubber friends app which is going to bigger and they want to add state management

02:00.890 --> 02:07.160
to it which we can do through redux which we're going to talk about in the next video.

02:07.300 --> 02:14.560
But as with anything a senior developers we have to think about why we would want to learn redox why

02:14.560 --> 02:22.630
we might improve this process that we see previously right over here in the next video we're going to

02:22.630 --> 02:32.850
talk about state management and understand why redux might improve upon react and often with applications

02:32.860 --> 02:38.290
you'll see both of them being used because it really really is a nice experience.

02:38.350 --> 02:45.260
By the end you're going to be able to speak intelligently about all three of these technologies.

02:46.390 --> 02:48.000
I'll see in the next one.

02:48.100 --> 02:48.340
Babai.
