00:00.650 --> 00:02.020
Walk them back.

00:02.220 --> 00:08.700
There's two other data types that we want to talk about in rattus and they're called assets and sorted

00:08.910 --> 00:09.570
sets.

00:11.600 --> 00:17.210
And sets and arrests are an ordered collection of strings.

00:17.690 --> 00:18.830
And that's why we have two types.

00:18.830 --> 00:26.910
We have sorted sets which are ordered and ordered which are sets and with sets.

00:26.910 --> 00:35.950
It's possible to add remove and test for existing members in a group and you might be thinking sets

00:35.950 --> 00:44.920
kind of sounds like lists but the one major difference with sets is that you have this desirable property

00:44.950 --> 00:52.580
of not allowing repeated values or members so adding the same element multiple times.

00:52.700 --> 00:57.380
It's actually not going to work or it's just going to give you a single copy of that element in the

00:57.380 --> 00:58.050
database.

00:59.190 --> 01:02.280
And this is a really really nice property to have.

01:03.080 --> 01:06.610
We make sure that we don't have any duplicates in our lives.

01:08.020 --> 01:14.920
Let's tryall some commands to see how we can add sets again unordered collections of strings.

01:16.470 --> 01:19.760
We simply say as add four sets.

01:20.130 --> 01:21.720
And we give it a key.

01:21.720 --> 01:29.100
So let's say our set and we'll say that we want to add a collection of numbers.

01:29.100 --> 01:38.400
Let's go with 1 2 3 4 5 and we just added some elements to our assets.

01:39.370 --> 01:49.910
Now I can say as members and give it the key our set and we get the members of whatever our set is.

01:49.990 --> 02:02.250
Now if I do ask add our Sat 2 3 or just to add 1 2 3 4 I get integers 0.

02:02.350 --> 02:05.220
And if I do as members are set

02:08.880 --> 02:15.930
I still get the original want 2 3 4 5 again because this has already existed.

02:16.050 --> 02:18.530
We've already created our set right up here.

02:19.570 --> 02:25.520
Another nice feature of sets is I can run the command S is member.

02:26.140 --> 02:33.480
And now with is member I can say are set and is 5 a member of our set.

02:33.800 --> 02:43.270
Yep I get one but if I say if 20 is a member of my set and no I get zero means it's not a member of

02:43.270 --> 02:50.340
the hour set value or our set key now.

02:50.360 --> 02:55.230
There's also such thing as sorted sets.

02:55.320 --> 03:03.060
Now red is sort of sets up just like sets do the no repeating collection of strings that we've already

03:03.060 --> 03:03.880
demonstrated.

03:04.110 --> 03:12.650
But the difference is that every member of a sort a set is associated with a score and this score allows

03:12.650 --> 03:15.830
it to be ordered from smallest to greatest.

03:15.830 --> 03:17.820
So let's have a look at how this works.

03:19.890 --> 03:23.010
I do sort of sense by saying Ziyad instead of Assad

03:26.110 --> 03:31.510
I can add different things let's say that sort set.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.900
It's going to be team.

03:35.140 --> 03:38.880
We'll give it a number we'll say team has 50 members.

03:39.600 --> 03:43.160
All cissÃ© Wizards.

03:46.430 --> 03:51.890
Now let's say that the next team which is now Weezer's will be the

03:54.950 --> 03:59.530
Lears groups the Samenow and do.

03:59.850 --> 04:04.460
And this team has 40 members.

04:05.760 --> 04:11.520
I can now access this by saying Z range and this Z range.

04:11.520 --> 04:21.690
I'll give it the team keep from 0 to 1 and you see that now I have the range.

04:21.690 --> 04:29.260
However it's ordered even though I've inserted Wizards first into the sorted sets.

04:29.310 --> 04:38.550
The Cavaliers appear first because the team number is lower with Cavalier's remember it goes from lower

04:38.550 --> 04:39.240
to higher.

04:39.300 --> 04:46.700
So if I add a nother team let's say that he only has one and there are going to be called

04:50.200 --> 04:53.220
let's say ballz.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.260
I can now say zero.

04:55.350 --> 04:57.820
And we want to grab all three.

04:58.230 --> 05:05.110
And I have ballz Cavalier's and wizards all sorted and there's other useful commands that we can use

05:05.110 --> 05:18.110
or we can say Z rank for example and we can find out what the team Wizards rank is and we get that their

05:18.110 --> 05:19.410
rank is too.

05:19.430 --> 05:27.660
Again it's not three because the order sosh from 0 7 0 1 to all right there's plenty other commands

05:27.660 --> 05:32.750
that you can learn with retests and they're really easy to follow just with your documentation.

05:32.790 --> 05:40.830
However you should have a good idea of why you'd want to use Retz if you want a fast data base that

05:41.040 --> 05:42.480
scales really really well.

05:42.480 --> 05:48.750
If we have a lot of users but also helps us out that we want to store the data types that it supports

05:48.750 --> 05:50.000
like the ones that we have.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.690
Well Rukun do some really neat things with it.

05:52.860 --> 05:59.130
And like I said we're going to be using rattus to manage our sessions in the sessions and JWT section

05:59.130 --> 06:01.100
of the course.

06:01.320 --> 06:05.640
Now that we have a good understanding of rattus go try out some of these commands.

06:05.640 --> 06:06.670
Play around with it.

06:06.690 --> 06:09.810
It's a lot of fun and I'll see in the next video by.
