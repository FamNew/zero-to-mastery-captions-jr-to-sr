00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:09.000
The Last Lecture we run into the problem that P S Q L is not recognized as Intel X telecom and the problem

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.120
is that it has to be registered in the system environmental path were.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:23.080
So if you Google a solution for this problem you find a bunch of things which all are good.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.000
But here is an easy way to do it.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:38.920
Just use two windows search engine by typing it and V and then you get the system environmental variables.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.790
Then it shows this like a nice little pop up where you can choose environmental variables.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.800
There are a lot of things defined already.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:57.530
And if you remember I tend to keep in mind that you should remember the path of where you stockpot Square

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.010
as well.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.530
So if you don't remember it it's not the problem don't worry.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:13.580
Just follow me and we can look up where it is in the File Explorer go to this PC choose your platform

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:23.730
and on there you have to program files and there is the postscripts will move into this directory in

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.610
the version number because you can install also lower versions than what version 10.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.610
And then you need to be intellectually move also in this one.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.530
Then you see here to create Depay which we also use in Andreas Whittier's.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.050
If you scroll down you will also find P Q L which you will need to also make it the way you will in

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.450
your command prompt.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.640
So how we can do that.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.170
Let us right click here in the address bar and copy our terrorists as text.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:08.040
Let me close this and back again in our When were environmental variables pop up choose path.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.030
This is important.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.050
You need to choose path.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:19.020
Then click on it and there is see which is already defined and then we also see our good old friends

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.900
get and no G-S.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.780
So we want to make a new path variable.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:35.900
So click on you and then just right click and paste the path to the post Chris skewl and then click

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:44.450
on OK click OK here click OK there and let us open the command prompt again.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.280
So let's test it.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.550
P S Q L.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.970
All right.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.380
It asks us about the passport.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.470
Let's try a test because this is the one I defined.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.180
And remember there you also don't see how many characters you typed in.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.310
So just hit enter after you typed in your passport

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.440
photo Passport authentication failed for you.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.180
The secret to mustardy.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.280
That's strange and it's really easy to resolve.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:29.550
You have to use an additional flag in Windows but typing P S Q L Desch capitalized you.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.590
And then you can type which user you want to look into postgresql.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.070
In our case resets the passport for the use of postscripts.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.360
So Type in post.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:51.260
Suppose Chris and the answer and then it asks for the password for the user postscripts in my case it

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.620
is test again.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.370
Type it in.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.090
Don't worry you don't see it but it work and then hit enter.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.360
All right.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.950
We are in postscripts mode.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.580
Or so.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:15.440
So let's create the database by using the command to create database and then the one which you already

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.850
know from under its Windows test and hit enter.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.050
Oh it does nothing.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.450
Well because I forgot the same code.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.150
So typing the semi-colon in the next line is also ok and hit enter.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.480
All right create database looks like it worked.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.780
So let me move on from the post Grossmont by hitting Control-C again and I'm out of it.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:54.750
So let's move on to PGE admin and have a look if it worked as we expected.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:04.090
Postscripts town at me for this thought of and we wouldn't know where we see our graphical user interface

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.310
and type then by hitting it on the plus sign plus sign again and again.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.080
All right here is the database test also.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:25.170
You will find your tables on the schemers tab here by hitting on the plus sign plus and public and that

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.890
scroll all the way down there you find tables.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:36.440
In our case we have no tables to fight because Andri uses the commands in the terminal.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:46.640
I will show you how you can do it with Peachi admin for footers right click on tables create table.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.590
You can give the table name an hour of case I'll choose users.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.670
You can also uncomment.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:05.150
This is the table we all use words or actions.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:15.910
And then you can't add collops first column I would choose Id of type integer and this is my primary

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:22.990
key and other one with the name because each user has a name.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:31.720
In theory choose to type character berrying which is the same as var char which is soil under his videos

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.000
with no length.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.080
This means it accepts every kind of length.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.830
Then you use of course there's always also an email address

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:52.160
also of type character varying and just leave this for now safe.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.740
And now we have our users table.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.260
Also let's fill it with some life.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:07.030
You can also insert data in PGA before you can do it by read click on users.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:13.030
Few enter data and choose all rows.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:20.790
They got a table like few where you can start typing without any need of KJo.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:32.550
So Id choose one for name I choose John save and for email I'd choose.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.450
Chone G-mail.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.260
Safe.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.780
Safe.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.590
All right.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.080
Looks that it has worked.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:49.200
So let's move back again to all rows.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.550
Yes indeed it worked.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:08:02.640
And now that we also use the command line tools let's change it to to come up prompt and as you know

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:13.670
again remember dash you post gross type in your password an hour and post-Christmas.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:24.420
So let's try if we also get the data here in the command prompt selects the our power users same column

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.030
0 relation users does not exist.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.580
Leinwand select start from users.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:35.920
Well this is because we have to change first into the right database.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.580
You can do it by typing backslash.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.150
See.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.170
And then the name from the database.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.230
In our case was text.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.030
Now we are connected to the test data base and let us try again.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:57.150
Our select command select star for all users semicon.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.900
All right there is our user job.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.750
So everything work as expected.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:03.550
All right.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:07.530
Now we close the last missing get for us Windows user.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.990
Nothing should stop you to become the next complete web developer.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:15.730
I wish you all the best and have fun throughout this course.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.950
Let's meet on this court order Q&amp;A.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.880
Feel free to take me every time you need help.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.720
Or are you stuck.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.200
I'll see you in the next one.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:24.810
Bye bye.
