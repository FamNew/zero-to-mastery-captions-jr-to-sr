00:01.130 --> 00:07.940
Welcome back it's time to finally make this profile update work and connect it to our Bacchante.

00:08.060 --> 00:12.800
Let's go back to our Front-End and in our profile.

00:12.910 --> 00:15.930
Yes this two a few things.

00:16.010 --> 00:24.770
First I want to make sure that whenever we update our input here we also update the state of our app

00:26.960 --> 00:38.140
so going back once again I'm going to do a new method here and change this stateless function into a

00:38.590 --> 00:39.610
class component.

00:39.610 --> 00:46.090
Now I could just create the function out here but I like using class components or class declaration

00:46.090 --> 00:48.940
whenever we have other methods that we want to use.

00:49.830 --> 00:53.900
So class extends or a class profile

00:56.500 --> 01:08.840
extends re-act dot component.

01:08.890 --> 01:10.210
This is going to have a render

01:13.500 --> 01:20.170
let's bring all of this inside the Rander.

01:20.180 --> 01:26.070
I'm just going to minimize this so we can see a better it's a lot better.

01:26.220 --> 01:34.090
And we also want to have a constructor vowel C props.

01:34.100 --> 01:45.770
Super props and here will say that this thought state and this is going to be interesting and we're

01:45.770 --> 01:47.860
going to talk about this a little bit.

01:48.230 --> 01:55.550
I'm going to have Neame equal to this Daut props dot user dot name.

01:55.550 --> 02:00.400
And if you're wondering why we do props for constructor and super and sometimes we don't.

02:00.620 --> 02:04.020
Well if you ever want to use this stop props inside of the constructor.

02:04.040 --> 02:08.330
This is why you need to do and we are in this case so that's why we're doing this.

02:09.770 --> 02:12.030
All right so we have user name.

02:12.240 --> 02:22.730
We also have H that is props start user dot page and we also have Pat this stop prop's dot user dot

02:22.910 --> 02:27.390
Pat All right what am I doing here.

02:27.390 --> 02:32.390
Why are we creating a state when these are already props.

02:32.400 --> 02:39.170
Why not just update the state where these things actually exist.

02:39.270 --> 02:40.950
And if you remember when we go to APT.

02:41.070 --> 02:41.420
Yes.

02:41.430 --> 02:47.240
If we scroll all the way up to our state well we already have all the user information here.

02:47.250 --> 02:57.120
Why don't we just update this and have an event in profile that triggers up to render.

02:57.170 --> 03:05.780
And here I want to demonstrate some good practices of thinking in terms of react and how it works you

03:05.780 --> 03:11.870
see with forms there's a lot of instances where I can't just have a user just keep typing keep typing

03:11.870 --> 03:18.710
keep typing and that causes a revenger because state is being updated and every time we update on change

03:18.830 --> 03:25.640
an input it renders renders we renderers we renders the component and all the components underneath

03:25.640 --> 03:26.780
it.

03:26.780 --> 03:35.520
Now because app is that our top level as soon as we update the state is going to render everything underneath

03:35.520 --> 03:35.840
it.

03:35.940 --> 03:38.520
And that's just a waste.

03:38.610 --> 03:48.350
And with form this is good practice that is if you have a form have a state that the form keeps and

03:48.380 --> 03:54.610
as soon as the user clicks submit or does some sort of an action that is important.

03:54.770 --> 04:02.330
Then we update the state so that we keep all the state updates as the users typing within here and only

04:02.330 --> 04:06.250
update the general big state that is in the top dog.

04:06.250 --> 04:06.850
Yes.

04:07.130 --> 04:09.270
After the user has confirmed that.

04:09.320 --> 04:09.670
All right.

04:09.710 --> 04:10.400
This is my name.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.090
This is age.

04:11.090 --> 04:16.750
This is Pat and we don't have to update sayt every time they make a mistake for example.

04:16.770 --> 04:17.470
All right.

04:17.480 --> 04:26.040
Now that we got that out of the way let's handle what we call a on form change and this on form change

04:26.070 --> 04:34.050
is going to accept an event and this is just typical event handling that we do with react.

04:34.110 --> 04:40.090
I can do it if steamy here but just for fun let's just do a switch statement that doesn't event dot

04:40.460 --> 04:43.120
target dot name.

04:43.380 --> 04:49.270
And this is going to handle based on the name of the target.

04:49.410 --> 04:51.820
And if you remember we scroll down.

04:51.960 --> 04:57.300
We've given inputs different names user age user name user or pet.

04:57.540 --> 05:04.600
So based on those inputs I can say let's minimize this just to look cleaner.

05:05.040 --> 05:16.710
I'm going to say that if case is user name in that case I want you to update this dot set.

05:16.770 --> 05:17.220
St.

05:19.900 --> 05:27.180
with name to equal the event dot target dot value.

05:28.490 --> 05:37.460
And we can break their otherwise with case user page.

05:37.540 --> 05:41.530
In that case well of this set state the

05:44.640 --> 05:47.480
event that target value

05:50.270 --> 05:52.420
again break.

05:52.430 --> 06:02.170
And then finally our last case we'll do a case user Pat this thoughts at state

06:06.630 --> 06:14.490
to be Pat equaling whatever the event target dot value is.

06:14.580 --> 06:21.760
Who then will obviously do a break and will always add a default that just simply returns

06:24.480 --> 06:29.260
not deterrence returns.

06:29.260 --> 06:31.530
All right let's say this.

06:31.730 --> 06:35.180
And we have a few areas here and we'll see what we've done.

06:35.210 --> 06:36.230
User is not defined.

06:36.230 --> 06:44.960
User is not defined well because we need to make sure that within the Rander we can open it within the

06:44.960 --> 06:48.820
render we're using the user data entry so let's do a concert

06:51.330 --> 06:56.790
user from the start props.

06:56.940 --> 06:59.750
Let's save all right.

06:59.780 --> 07:03.910
And we have a few things we have returns Whoops.

07:04.140 --> 07:05.930
Swish them and make sure I fix that.

07:06.140 --> 07:09.540
And then we also have toggle motile is not defined.

07:09.590 --> 07:20.490
Again we need to make sure that we now within the toggle modal call this the props or toggle motile

07:20.970 --> 07:28.720
and this dog props dot toggle motile because it's not a stateless function like we had it before we

07:28.730 --> 07:29.400
save.

07:29.660 --> 07:29.960
All right.

07:29.960 --> 07:39.380
Everything is passing if we go back to our app sign in with our good friend a sign an and we go to the

07:39.380 --> 07:49.110
profile update the name open up the console.

07:49.130 --> 07:49.740
All right.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.390
Nowhere's that's good.

07:51.600 --> 07:57.140
But wouldn't it be nice if we'd type here and this name also gets updated.

07:58.340 --> 08:02.750
And remember we're in our own state here before we actually hit save.

08:02.840 --> 08:06.210
We haven't really updated the state in the apt.

08:06.310 --> 08:13.800
Yes but within the form will be nice to be able to change the user name to see how it displays so we

08:13.800 --> 08:16.100
can do that by going back to our profile.

08:18.150 --> 08:19.980
Let's make this a little bit smaller.

08:21.400 --> 08:30.880
And now the user name here that we use can instead be this dot state DOT user.

08:30.970 --> 08:40.340
Let's save this go back have to sign and once again go to your profile.

08:40.340 --> 08:41.310
Type something.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.340
But now we see that we don't have the user name

08:47.450 --> 08:48.620
and silly me.

08:48.650 --> 08:53.920
It's not user it's name member remember our state just has name age impact.

08:53.990 --> 08:56.650
Let's save.

08:56.810 --> 09:03.710
And then the final thing we want to do is actually call this on form change event.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.520
Now where should we call that.

09:05.840 --> 09:17.190
Well for each input we can just say that there is an on change that takes this dot on form change event

09:18.200 --> 09:18.690
again.

09:18.720 --> 09:22.440
Just gonna copy and paste this to all the inputs

09:25.330 --> 09:33.240
let's save and let's see if this finally works sign in again because we do that all the time.

09:33.310 --> 09:37.020
Seinen view profile.

09:37.220 --> 09:39.280
Start typing.

09:39.430 --> 09:41.090
Look at that.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.700
Our event is being fired.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.880
We're never updating the app state.

09:45.880 --> 09:50.220
We're only rendering just this little tiny portion that we need to.

09:50.590 --> 09:57.460
But as soon as I click save I want to make sure that this name gets updated.

09:57.820 --> 10:05.770
So let's finish this off by doing a post request with this information that we have and the form state.

10:05.820 --> 10:07.200
See in the next one.

10:07.540 --> 10:07.750
Bobby.
