00:01.120 --> 00:04.030
All right how does the exercise look at this.

00:04.030 --> 00:08.330
While I've been waiting for you this image is still loading this website now.

00:08.350 --> 00:09.220
Very good is it.

00:10.160 --> 00:15.680
I wanted to know that there's a few things you might notice in here that while you might not see and

00:15.680 --> 00:21.070
that is because browsers and you might have plug ins that do some extra things on your Web site but

00:21.080 --> 00:27.580
as long as you see the scripts and the images that we've provided for the exercise that's all good.

00:28.780 --> 00:32.200
So how can you improve this Web site.

00:33.650 --> 00:36.110
Shouldn't be too too difficult.

00:36.110 --> 00:44.120
We can see that we can minimize all text and yes you can even minimize the ASTM file even though the

00:44.120 --> 00:47.190
savings might be small but he can do that.

00:47.360 --> 00:54.440
You can go to style and also minimize each one of these files.

00:54.540 --> 00:59.140
This is style and this style using something like mid-fi Julius

01:04.170 --> 01:09.640
and if we do the minute fire over here we can also mid-fi our CSSA.

01:09.640 --> 01:17.300
You can just simply copy and paste whatever we have which frankly isn't a lot but it would mystify it

01:17.300 --> 01:28.250
for us and I can just copy and paste this into my code and this way all this whitespace will be gone.

01:31.230 --> 01:37.470
And again with my script files I can do the same.

01:37.730 --> 01:46.580
And we see over here that it took 2.5 minutes for this puppy image to get downloaded which is really

01:46.580 --> 01:47.150
really slow.

01:47.150 --> 01:50.100
Again we're on the slow 3G network here.

01:50.300 --> 01:53.160
So let's just make a quick little fix here.

01:54.170 --> 02:00.660
So I'm going to open this file and this puppy image I'm going to open it up.

02:01.960 --> 02:08.200
And if I adjust the size of this image for now again I don't need all these pixels.

02:08.200 --> 02:12.840
I can just simply see that an index that a shemale file.

02:12.910 --> 02:15.990
I only need this to be 300 by 200.

02:17.480 --> 02:26.920
All right so if I do 300 by 200 MY image just went from 5.6 megabytes to 15 kilowatts.

02:27.380 --> 02:30.420
Let's say that hurry.

02:30.430 --> 02:31.860
That's a lot better.

02:31.960 --> 02:39.110
Let's exit out of this and I'm just going to my browser is just doing stuff on its own.

02:39.210 --> 02:40.500
So let's start over.

02:40.500 --> 02:41.930
I'm going to hard refresh

02:52.180 --> 03:02.530
and we see that the image now is already loaded you can see that the puppy jpeg was downloaded in three

03:02.530 --> 03:05.900
seconds from 2.5 minutes to three seconds.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.510
That's not that.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.710
And we can probably optimize this even more.

03:12.570 --> 03:12.780
All right.

03:12.830 --> 03:18.440
The next one is media queries and this one I kind of cheated because I've shown you how to do this before.

03:18.800 --> 03:24.890
But you can see over here that maybe we don't want the large background we only want it for a small

03:24.890 --> 03:25.840
screen size.

03:26.300 --> 03:38.980
So perhaps I can remove this and now this will never have to load a large background image only one

03:38.980 --> 03:40.750
the screen size is tiny

03:45.390 --> 03:48.740
and you can play around with media queries and try different things.

03:50.020 --> 03:56.990
Now finally the minimizing number of files and this is really easy to do.

03:57.040 --> 04:04.210
All we have to do is make sure that instead of having two stylesheets we can just combine them because

04:04.210 --> 04:05.330
they're not that big.

04:05.740 --> 04:14.700
So I can just put my H-1 into this file and that way we only have one file to deliver.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.340
We can do the same thing with Javascript.

04:17.340 --> 04:24.070
And so having these three script files I'll just combine it all into one because they all should do

04:24.070 --> 04:30.590
the same thing once console logging while all of them are logging.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.240
And this is something called bundling.

04:33.420 --> 04:41.090
We're bundling our files into one and doing this manually is not very fun and there's tools like well-packed

04:41.100 --> 04:44.540
that do this for us now and we'll get into that later on.

04:45.860 --> 04:53.430
But we can see that using these four techniques we can significantly improve the speed of this website.

04:53.780 --> 04:57.160
Hopefully you were able to do some of these sayings.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.540
I'm sure wasn't too too difficult.

04:59.720 --> 05:04.910
But like I said things are going to get more and more interesting as we progress through the course.

05:04.910 --> 05:09.600
Hope you had fun in this exercise and I'll see in the next one.

05:09.750 --> 05:09.990
Babai.
