Hey it's Bruno here and oh man look at this Web site it's so fast you're incredible I'm so glad that

00:09.130 --> 00:11.070
I hired you man.

00:11.180 --> 00:11.820
OK.

00:12.100 --> 00:14.110
I think I need to put you on bigger projects.

00:14.110 --> 00:20.770
Next to well done really really fantastic work all right.

00:20.790 --> 00:22.440
Bruno's impressed with our work.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.060
Not bad.

00:23.060 --> 00:23.910
Not bad.

00:24.150 --> 00:28.290
But I have a feeling he's going to be asking even more of us so we've got to stay.

00:28.290 --> 00:29.280
Stay on our toes.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.290
Got to stay sharp.

00:31.440 --> 00:39.590
Anyway to finish off this section I want to leave you with this one famous quote premature optimization

00:40.010 --> 00:42.980
is the root of all evil.

00:43.080 --> 00:48.330
If you're not shipping your product because you're trying to get a really really fast but you have zero

00:48.330 --> 00:50.670
users you're wasting your time.

00:51.540 --> 00:56.090
As you'll learn throughout this course everything is a tradeoff.

00:56.310 --> 01:03.690
And a senior developer is someone who can look at the big picture analyze the pros and cons and decide

01:03.900 --> 01:06.400
what is the best direction to take.

01:07.640 --> 01:10.690
Keep that in mind as you progress through your career.

01:10.880 --> 01:18.780
Optimize for fast slowing performance relative to device and network capabilities of your users.

01:18.780 --> 01:26.580
Tried to load your page really fast ideally in under five seconds and always test your performance on

01:26.580 --> 01:31.270
mobile devices on different network connections and experiment.

01:32.620 --> 01:34.990
I hope you had fun in this section.

01:34.990 --> 01:37.030
Things are going to get even more exciting.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.240
I know I keep saying that but I mean it.

01:39.490 --> 01:44.830
We're going to go learn a few different things and then we're going to come back to performance and

01:44.890 --> 01:52.630
talk about the other parts are front end and then finally finish off with the back end which is definitely

01:52.630 --> 01:53.720
my favorite.

01:53.830 --> 01:56.100
So good job getting this far.

01:56.290 --> 01:59.880
You've still got a long way to go but I've got faith.

01:59.980 --> 02:01.230
I'll see you in the next one.

02:01.510 --> 02:01.970
Bye bye.
