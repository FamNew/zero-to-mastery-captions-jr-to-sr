Welcome back honors take a bit of time to talk about the surveillance framework and something that I

00:06.330 --> 00:12.750
may have skimmed over a little too quickly and the previous video and that is the fact that server less

00:12.990 --> 00:18.580
isn't just for Amazon Web services you can use it with a ton of things.

00:18.780 --> 00:21.280
You see that in the server less create command.

00:21.300 --> 00:27.480
We have all these templates and we use the Amazon know James.

00:27.730 --> 00:30.830
There's also Amazon with typescript.

00:30.880 --> 00:34.910
There's Python there's Java.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.480
There's all these other things.

00:36.760 --> 00:42.700
But also if we keep going down we see open wisk which is IBM.

00:42.790 --> 00:49.990
So IBM is webservices as well as if we keep going down we see that there's also Azure.

00:50.150 --> 00:53.400
So that is Microsoft that offers these services.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.600
You also have Google.

00:54.710 --> 01:01.330
So Servilius works with all of these service providers which is really really nice.

01:01.340 --> 01:07.520
Another reason I like showing gyud this method is because we're learning how to use not just AWOS but

01:07.520 --> 01:12.170
also all these other services that might meet your needs better.

01:12.330 --> 01:21.000
Now since we got that through the other thing I want to do is I want to make sure that my rankly which

01:21.000 --> 01:27.630
remember our node version here is 6.10 and because we're going to be deploying it from our server less

01:28.200 --> 01:37.300
framework will have to go back to our dashboard and remove this rankly lambda function because we don't

01:37.300 --> 01:40.220
want to create it here we're creating it through server less.

01:40.300 --> 01:50.970
So I'm going to go back to functions and just remove rankly goodbye rankly your life was short lived.

01:50.980 --> 01:56.310
All right let's minimize this and talk a little bit about the YAML file.

01:57.660 --> 02:03.470
The server less documentation is really really good at explaining all of these.

02:03.560 --> 02:08.970
So I'm not going to take too much time doing that because each one of them is different but you can

02:09.230 --> 02:11.840
write a bunch of defaults that they already have.

02:11.900 --> 02:18.380
For example in here if we uncomment this we see that we have regions where we want our server to be

02:19.850 --> 02:26.270
if you live somewhere else other than the North American you might want to change this so that the server

02:26.270 --> 02:34.380
is going to be closer to your users if you keep scrolling down you see that we also have environmental

02:34.380 --> 02:37.140
variables that we can add to our functions.

02:38.010 --> 02:45.220
For maybe perhaps making sure that the secrets stay outside of our functions and then obviously we've

02:45.240 --> 02:52.770
talked about the functions before we have our functions that we define called Hello so we can access

02:52.770 --> 02:58.840
it with the name hello and this can be changed to watever and it references the handler dodgiest function

03:02.330 --> 03:04.250
the in the YAML file.

03:04.260 --> 03:09.960
The following are a few example events that you can configure so we can configure different events that

03:09.960 --> 03:13.080
the helo function will be triggered with.

03:13.080 --> 03:17.630
For example we can do a sheepy we can do as three.

03:17.630 --> 03:24.470
So let's say somebody loads an image to an S3 bracket like a profile image and we need to let's say

03:24.470 --> 03:32.840
resize it well the trigger is going to be the ESRI image that gets uploaded and then that's going to

03:32.840 --> 03:36.940
trigger the helo function to do something.

03:36.970 --> 03:42.400
And by the way we're going to be using a CGP in our case but I wanted to show you that there's different

03:42.400 --> 03:44.190
things we can do for example.

03:44.200 --> 03:47.570
Another one that I really like using is the schedule.

03:47.770 --> 03:51.130
And here I can say how often I want the function to run.

03:51.130 --> 03:57.570
For example if I want a function to run every hour maybe to check a stock market price.

03:57.640 --> 04:01.690
Well I can tell it to run every hour and that every hour.

04:01.690 --> 04:03.390
The function is going to run.

04:03.580 --> 04:09.740
And if you use an API like Twilio that sends you text messages you can have every hour a text message

04:09.740 --> 04:15.990
just says the stock price is so-and-so or the stock price has gone up 100 percent.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.180
You're now Rich something along those lines.

04:20.390 --> 04:23.420
And there's a lot of things that we can go through here.

04:23.570 --> 04:29.420
But like I said these are all configuration items that you'll encounter when you actually have a specific

04:29.420 --> 04:35.900
need for a function while we're going to do now is build out our function.

04:36.010 --> 04:42.460
But there's one last configuration item that we need to do with server less before we have access to

04:42.460 --> 04:44.640
our AWOS account.

04:44.740 --> 04:53.020
You see right now I've created this service framework that lives on my laptop but yes doesn't really

04:53.020 --> 04:54.370
know that this exists.

04:54.370 --> 04:59.860
I need to connect my account to this server list framework so that I can write the function and then

05:00.010 --> 05:01.470
deploy it.

05:01.480 --> 05:04.030
So let's do that in the next video.

05:04.070 --> 05:04.920
I'll see you in that one.
