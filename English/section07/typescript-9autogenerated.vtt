00:01.350 --> 00:02.250
Welcome back.

00:02.250 --> 00:02.790
All right.

00:02.790 --> 00:04.230
Don't get mad at me but I lied.

00:04.230 --> 00:07.110
There's one other type that I need to show you.

00:07.230 --> 00:13.770
And it's a new feature and typescript and it's called a union type.

00:13.800 --> 00:17.720
This is a very simple one a union type is.

00:17.820 --> 00:18.730
Well let me show you.

00:19.050 --> 00:27.690
It's a lot confused and I'm confused because this variable can be a string or a number.

00:27.690 --> 00:28.570
How do we do that.

00:28.740 --> 00:31.440
Well with a union type and you can see this.

00:31.430 --> 00:34.880
This is the shift and the button.

00:34.920 --> 00:37.410
Right above my return key on a Mac.

00:37.440 --> 00:43.770
It's this little line over here and I can say it can be a string or a number and I can say.

00:44.100 --> 00:46.630
He calls hello.

00:46.860 --> 00:47.800
I say this.

00:47.850 --> 00:49.270
Everything still works.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.930
If I do.

00:51.960 --> 00:56.500
If I changed this to a number like 5.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.520
It still works but if I change it to a boolean like true it will fail.

01:03.540 --> 01:07.440
I was able to say it could be this or it could be this and I can keep changing them.

01:07.440 --> 01:10.970
I can say this is also a boolean.

01:11.580 --> 01:14.100
And that works as well.

01:14.100 --> 01:15.860
Nice and easy union type.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.760
It can be quite quite useful.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.330
I'll see in the next one.
