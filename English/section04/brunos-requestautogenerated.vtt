Hey it's Bruno here.

00:02.950 --> 00:10.030
Man we've been getting some really really great comments about our new fast web site.

00:10.070 --> 00:11.420
Really amazing work.

00:11.420 --> 00:19.700
Hey listen I know you just started but our robo friends app which has become really really popular needs

00:19.700 --> 00:22.760
a little bit of an upgrade.

00:22.790 --> 00:30.620
It's written right now in react but I heard that this library redux may be able to help us scale and

00:31.400 --> 00:34.750
make our app more maintainable in the long term.

00:34.880 --> 00:39.920
Do you want to go ahead and take the lead to add Reebok's to our robo friends up.

00:40.460 --> 00:41.570
Great.

00:41.630 --> 00:43.460
I know I can trust you.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.720
You've been really really good.

00:44.810 --> 00:47.440
By the way nice haircut you look good today.

00:49.420 --> 00:50.090
Oh boy.

00:50.440 --> 00:53.390
You know exactly what Bruno does.

00:53.410 --> 00:55.360
You're starting to catch on to him.

00:55.360 --> 00:57.880
He starts out with a nice compliment.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.620
Makes us feel good.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.990
Asked us to do stuff and then finish off.

01:01.990 --> 01:06.340
Finishes off with a random compliment like nice haircut.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.140
We do have really nice haircuts though.

01:09.020 --> 01:16.010
Anyway classic Bruno just using a compliment sandwich to make us do more things but oh well we enjoy

01:16.010 --> 01:17.270
doing it right.

01:17.300 --> 01:18.410
Plus we got this.

01:18.410 --> 01:19.550
Easy peasy.

01:19.550 --> 01:21.220
Let's get to work shall we.

01:21.230 --> 01:23.340
Let's learn about some exciting topics.

01:23.540 --> 01:25.380
I'll see in the next video Bebai.
