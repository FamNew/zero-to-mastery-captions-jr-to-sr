Hey it's Bruno here.

00:02.960 --> 00:06.810
Listen great job so far on the sessions really loved your work.

00:06.830 --> 00:14.600
We're actually started to grow quite a bit at Kaikohe Corp. and just managing all the servers and databases

00:14.690 --> 00:22.730
is becoming really really hard and we're thinking about switching some of our services to AWOS and we

00:22.730 --> 00:26.340
wanted to test out the waters and see if this is something we want to do.

00:26.540 --> 00:29.330
And maybe you can help us with some of this.

00:29.390 --> 00:35.510
We're actually looking to incorporate a new badge system in our smart brain app perhaps give badges

00:35.510 --> 00:39.640
to our users based on how many images they've submitted.

00:39.710 --> 00:44.940
And I heard A.W. Yes lambda is really really good for something like this.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.420
Maybe you can help set that up for us.

00:47.420 --> 00:48.000
Cool.

00:48.260 --> 00:48.940
Thank you.

00:48.950 --> 00:50.390
Always it.

00:50.420 --> 00:51.770
By the way you look fit.

00:51.770 --> 00:52.940
Have you been working out.

00:55.050 --> 00:55.670
All right.

00:55.740 --> 00:56.860
Here it goes again.

00:56.940 --> 01:00.270
Another chapter in our developer career.

01:00.340 --> 01:08.410
We're going to learn about a very important concept that is AWOS and using infrastructure as a service

01:08.620 --> 01:15.780
or a platform as a service to manage some of the big headaches that comes with managing your own service.

01:17.570 --> 01:22.660
And it's going to be a really fun one and it's going to open up a whole world of possibilities.

01:22.700 --> 01:23.990
So hang on tight.

01:24.050 --> 01:26.500
Let's get to work and I'll see you in the next video.

01:26.880 --> 01:27.410
Bye bye.
