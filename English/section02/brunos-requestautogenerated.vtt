Hey it's Bruno here.

00:02.790 --> 00:05.200
Hope you're having a good first day of work.

00:05.340 --> 00:08.640
You know hopefully everything set up, everybody's been nice to you.

00:08.640 --> 00:10.670
Hey listen can you do me a favor?

00:10.680 --> 00:13.840
Can you set up SSH on your GitHub account?

00:14.010 --> 00:18.900
We want to get started with you working and we have lots of projects in the pipeline, so hopefully you

00:18.900 --> 00:20.790
can set that up by the end of the day today.

00:20.790 --> 00:21.630
All right cool.

00:21.630 --> 00:22.880
Thanks appreciate it.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.670
Buh-Bye.

00:24.780 --> 00:25.440
All right.

00:25.440 --> 00:33.390
It's time for us to learn SSH set up our SSH with GitHub and hopefully have a successful first day

00:33.390 --> 00:34.430
at work.

00:34.440 --> 00:35.900
I'll see you in the next video.

00:36.220 --> 00:36.450
Buh-Bye.
