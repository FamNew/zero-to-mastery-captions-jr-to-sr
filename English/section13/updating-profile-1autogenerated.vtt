00:00.720 --> 00:01.770
Welcome back.

00:01.770 --> 00:09.330
Let's work on the profile update function a very important point that's well we want to make sure we

00:09.330 --> 00:14.130
protect We don't want anybody to be able to update a profile.

00:14.460 --> 00:19.210
And we finally get to work a bit of the backend.

00:19.370 --> 00:21.420
Now what we want to do here.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.630
I'm going to minimize this.

00:23.830 --> 00:37.910
And within our routes and our express app will create an app dot post that is the profile with the parameter

00:37.910 --> 00:39.850
that is Heidi.

00:40.040 --> 00:49.350
And this is going to have a request response that will have what should it have.

00:49.370 --> 01:00.720
Well we want the profile to handle profile update and we pass in the request response object as well

01:00.750 --> 01:08.360
as our D-B object so that we can connect to the database and actually update the user database.

01:08.370 --> 01:11.480
So request response D.B

01:14.320 --> 01:24.630
let's save you see that we've noticed the change in our Daker container which is very very nice.

01:24.640 --> 01:32.110
Now let's actually build this handle profile update we once again go to our controllers to profile and

01:32.140 --> 01:42.610
instead of handle profiles get we'll create a new function called handle profile update and it's going

01:42.610 --> 01:51.910
to be a simple function this simple function is going to accept a request a response and the db that

01:51.910 --> 01:53.100
we just passed it on.

01:53.320 --> 02:04.360
And inside of here we're going to grab the ID from request dot.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.550
Remember that's the field over here that we provide.

02:08.590 --> 02:15.920
So it can be profiled 23 poor file one if it's profile one will grab the a user that we have.

02:16.270 --> 02:22.300
And in the security section we discussed this idea of always never trusting inputs and what user sends

02:22.300 --> 02:22.540
you.

02:22.540 --> 02:28.060
And we can do some checking here to make sure that Puranas exists make sure that whatever we expect

02:28.210 --> 02:30.100
from the client side is correct.

02:30.100 --> 02:33.670
But for time's sake we're going to focus on just profile update.

02:33.700 --> 02:36.340
Otherwise we're just going to be spending way too long.

02:36.340 --> 02:37.750
You watch Yumiko.

02:38.140 --> 02:38.650
All right.

02:38.650 --> 02:50.660
We also want to grab the name age and pet object that we're going to send from the request of body form

02:51.280 --> 02:52.300
input.

02:52.450 --> 02:58.480
Now we haven't actually done this on the client side but we want to send a form and put object that

02:58.480 --> 03:01.820
contains name age and Pat.

03:01.910 --> 03:09.730
And now with our D-B object we can use Carnac's to simply say I want D-B users.

03:09.830 --> 03:14.900
And once again if you're not familiar with K'NEX you can just go to their documentation and it's very

03:14.900 --> 03:15.590
very simple.

03:15.590 --> 03:18.380
It reads like English and you'll see what I mean now.

03:18.710 --> 03:26.560
I'm going to say grab the user stable where the ID

03:30.080 --> 03:30.870
is already.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.590
I can just make that simplified and keep it like this.

03:34.610 --> 03:41.970
So where the ID matches with whatever we've provided and in that case we want to update.

03:42.290 --> 03:50.130
And for now because we don't have the age column the pet column in our database yet that's going to

03:50.130 --> 03:54.770
be one of your exercises we're just going to worry about updating the name.

03:54.790 --> 04:00.330
So I'm just going to say update name again I can just simplify it and do name

04:04.200 --> 04:08.280
because that's the column name of the users table.

04:08.280 --> 04:14.810
Finally we can do a dot then and once we get a response from that

04:21.060 --> 04:21.870
we'll say that.

04:21.890 --> 04:24.360
Whoops that's not what we wanted to do.

04:24.930 --> 04:27.160
We'll say that we want to.

04:27.360 --> 04:32.080
Well if there is some sort of a response and we can do a bit of checking here.

04:32.100 --> 04:38.260
But if there is a response from the database which is what we want we'll respond with.

04:38.850 --> 04:48.770
Jason let's just say success because we've updated the user successfully.

04:49.010 --> 05:03.260
Otherwise we will just respond with a status of 400 and we can just say Jason for an hour just leave

05:03.260 --> 05:03.420
it.

05:03.420 --> 05:10.410
It's not found or let's just say on unable to update

05:13.540 --> 05:20.380
and of course with any promise we want to do a catch to catch any errors and in our case we'll just

05:20.380 --> 05:37.860
say that the air will just do a response status of 400 a day and a response of error updating user.

05:37.860 --> 05:39.660
All right let's save here.

05:41.490 --> 05:42.780
See if we get any errors.

05:42.780 --> 05:43.620
No errors yet.

05:43.620 --> 05:44.910
That's always a good sign.

05:44.910 --> 05:53.050
So let's give the handle a profile update here make sure we export in.

05:53.210 --> 05:56.650
And now we should have this available in our server.

05:57.090 --> 06:05.510
JS now to test this to do a post request we can either start working on the front end side and do a

06:05.510 --> 06:12.650
Fettes request or we can use something like Postman and Postman is something that we've used before

06:12.650 --> 06:13.830
in my previous course.

06:13.850 --> 06:21.600
It's absolutely amazing if you're ever working with API eyes and building out your own restfully API.

06:21.770 --> 06:27.890
You must be while you must use postman it's absolutely great and you'll see why now.

06:28.220 --> 06:34.400
I'm going to do a post request to localhost and Olby 3000.

06:34.790 --> 06:43.010
And it's going to be to profile Heidi of one because we only have one user now in the body.

06:43.010 --> 06:48.590
We want to say that it's going to be raw Jaison that we send.

06:48.820 --> 06:55.370
It's going to have a form and put make sure that this is Jason.

06:55.530 --> 06:57.200
Let's say form and put

07:00.050 --> 07:05.910
and this form input is going to have name of let's say

07:09.150 --> 07:15.660
Johnny page of 54.

07:15.840 --> 07:21.110
And finally Pat that is just say

07:24.460 --> 07:30.970
five click send here I get a success.

07:30.970 --> 07:41.840
I was able to enter the body give it some input and if we go back we see that all right there was a

07:41.840 --> 07:49.210
post request to profile one.

07:49.220 --> 07:50.830
Here's the fun part.

07:50.840 --> 07:53.850
Let's go back to our

07:57.030 --> 07:59.370
and just sign in again.

07:59.550 --> 08:07.780
We'll say at a Tom Pastore day and look at that our users name is now Johnny.

08:07.850 --> 08:13.680
We've successfully created the handle profile update function.

08:13.810 --> 08:15.520
That's pretty amazing.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.410
And in quite a few lines of code.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.160
That wasn't that bad was it.

08:20.280 --> 08:30.480
We just simply created a post request and that post request is simply waiting for parameter of ID name

08:30.480 --> 08:36.510
age and Pat from the form input all the body and then we just update the users database.

08:36.660 --> 08:44.310
As long as the ID matches what you provided and it updates in our case just the name it's going to return

08:44.310 --> 08:48.980
a success or unable to update based on while we've done.

08:49.100 --> 08:49.340
All right.

08:49.340 --> 08:51.260
Just not just so we don't get confused.

08:51.290 --> 08:58.680
Let's go back to postman and make sure we change Johnny's name to a just in case it's success again.

08:58.850 --> 09:06.010
If I refresh we had a a a sign in.

09:06.060 --> 09:08.230
All right we're back to normal.

09:08.250 --> 09:09.420
Everything's good.

09:10.460 --> 09:14.520
We have our user the way we need it hostile.

09:14.740 --> 09:19.960
So now that we have this handle profile update we're actually going to connect it to the client side

09:20.230 --> 09:27.580
so that when we hit save on our profile page it's going to work it's going to be a lot of fun.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.820
I'll see in the next video by.
