00:01.720 --> 00:08.790
In this section we're going to talk about all these topics and this is something that I created called

00:09.030 --> 00:11.130
the star of security.

00:11.160 --> 00:17.580
I know I'm not very good with naming but I want you to use this as a reference that you can come back

00:17.580 --> 00:26.160
to and check to see if you've applied these principles in your applications if you practice these when

00:26.160 --> 00:32.100
working as a developer you're going to be miles ahead of most programmers.

00:32.170 --> 00:38.080
We're going to talk about each one separately and I'll show you how you can safeguard against them and

00:38.080 --> 00:40.120
what some of the best practices are.

00:40.150 --> 00:46.900
Like I said I have this as a reference and come back to it by the end of this section you're going to

00:46.900 --> 00:53.650
feel comfortable with each topic and be able to create secure applications which means people will trust

00:53.650 --> 00:57.300
you to leave projects for them and manage developers.

00:58.190 --> 00:59.120
I'll see in the next video.
