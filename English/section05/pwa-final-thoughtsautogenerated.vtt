Know that we understand progressive webapps I just want to add a few closing thoughts.

00:07.240 --> 00:14.090
Progressive Web apps have a great goal and might make Web sites faster and better for the user.

00:15.030 --> 00:21.030
However as with all new technology it still has some kinks to work out.

00:22.260 --> 00:26.850
As you can imagine it isn't really in the best interests of Apple.

00:26.850 --> 00:33.080
As we mentioned before that's why Safari support is really slow right now for progressive Web apps will

00:33.090 --> 00:34.620
improve over time.

00:34.710 --> 00:39.240
But you have to be careful between the browsers what works and what doesn't.

00:39.240 --> 00:45.990
When building a progressive Web apps things such as push notifications can be achieved on some browsers

00:46.110 --> 00:46.990
and not others.

00:47.310 --> 00:56.310
And push API and the notification API that uses push notifications requires integration with the backend.

00:56.550 --> 00:59.380
That adds an extra layer of complexity.

00:59.670 --> 01:05.770
And does everybody love push notifications and getting bugged from an app.

01:05.870 --> 01:10.940
I know that when I'm visiting a Web site getting notifications to added to my home screen is really

01:10.940 --> 01:11.950
really annoying.

01:12.380 --> 01:17.160
Did you actually ever download an ad to homescreen notification.

01:17.380 --> 01:24.130
Companies like Twitter and tender use progressive Web apps and companies like Lyft are really trying

01:24.130 --> 01:30.880
to make their progressive Web apps as similar as possible to their native apps which is always a good

01:30.880 --> 01:31.660
sign.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.570
With these sort of technologies.

01:33.610 --> 01:37.060
Be careful not to just get caught up in the hype.

01:37.150 --> 01:43.810
Every situation is different and depending on your project goals you may or may not benefit from progressive

01:43.890 --> 01:45.880
webapps as always.

01:45.880 --> 01:49.390
Decide if the effort is worth the benefit.

01:49.750 --> 01:56.290
Luckily for most projects progress of web apps does help because even if its not all the features that

01:56.290 --> 02:02.540
are being used the browsers that do support it will give a better experience for the user.
