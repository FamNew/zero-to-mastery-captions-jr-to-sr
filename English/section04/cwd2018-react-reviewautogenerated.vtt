Welcome back at the beginning of this reac section I told you that things are going to get a little

00:07.000 --> 00:07.860
bit overwhelming.

00:07.900 --> 00:11.670
But at the end you're going to understand everything and things are going to make sense.

00:12.560 --> 00:15.670
I want to show you exactly how much you've learned.

00:15.860 --> 00:17.610
You've learned that components.

00:17.660 --> 00:19.770
Well now this makes sense right.

00:19.790 --> 00:25.790
You were building components during this section to combine things into containers and then finally

00:25.790 --> 00:28.300
have a page or an app.

00:28.390 --> 00:36.550
You also learn that there is one way data flow that is everything flows from state to props and you

00:36.550 --> 00:43.660
can have multiple children but the only people that can change state is a container component.

00:43.720 --> 00:50.260
In our case we only have one container component but you can have multiple and data are just flows down

00:50.260 --> 00:57.010
one way and any time a child component changes they just trigger an event on the parent.

00:57.010 --> 01:04.030
And he saw how awesome that was and think about how we surrender things we were doing things deterministically.

01:04.060 --> 01:07.700
That is here's the state of the app render it accordingly.

01:07.750 --> 01:09.570
And re-act took care of it for us.

01:10.690 --> 01:17.710
We also learned that wolt exactly what I said re-act worries about painting and making the website look

01:17.710 --> 01:18.310
good.

01:18.310 --> 01:23.680
We just give it the data and the components.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.810
We learned that re-act has an awesome ecosystem.

01:26.840 --> 01:33.820
We had great tools where we're able to start and build and it gave us great errors.

01:33.860 --> 01:37.160
So all these pain points that we had when we were first building our Web sites.

01:37.190 --> 01:37.910
Well they're gone.

01:37.910 --> 01:43.250
Everything is built for you so that you're ready to just focus on coding without having to worry about

01:43.250 --> 01:44.660
configuration.

01:44.660 --> 01:50.060
When we get to our final project we're going to be using Riak components to build something really fast

01:50.210 --> 01:53.370
and just plug and play of these components.

01:54.540 --> 01:58.860
And finally well this should all look confusing to you anymore.

01:58.860 --> 02:00.150
This makes sense.

02:00.150 --> 02:08.070
This whole thing that looked intimidating at first will this is just react in this one image you have

02:08.430 --> 02:11.000
majority of why react is.

02:11.180 --> 02:18.470
And once you get used to the syntax it's an elegant solution to building beautiful web apps that are

02:18.470 --> 02:21.060
simple scalable and easy to manage.

02:23.340 --> 02:28.950
Good job getting this far in the course it takes a lot of dedication to get through this but you did

02:28.950 --> 02:32.080
it you're almost there.

02:32.210 --> 02:33.700
I'll see in the next one.

02:33.840 --> 02:34.100
Babai.
