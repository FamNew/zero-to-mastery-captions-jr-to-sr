00:01.280 --> 00:02.510
Welcome back.

00:02.750 --> 00:08.870
I want to take one video to discover thing that might trip up a lot of people when they're first starting

00:08.870 --> 00:19.830
off with re-act remember re-act is only a new layer library thus re-act only enables you to build component

00:19.920 --> 00:29.720
driven user interfaces and it has some solutions such as its own local state management and a simple

00:29.720 --> 00:34.040
way to handle events to make interactions on our website happen.

00:35.440 --> 00:40.110
But at the end of the day it's a simple library that helps with the view.

00:40.360 --> 00:48.430
Once you start building large scale applications you need to add on top of react.

00:48.700 --> 00:55.630
The power of re-act comes from this ability to tack on new features new libraries to it in order to

00:55.630 --> 00:59.520
customize it to your own liking to your own app.

00:59.660 --> 01:08.270
So as applications grow or you start working for a large company you'll see them use some other tools

01:08.360 --> 01:14.810
on top of that and I wanted to go over quickly some of the ones that are the most common common to see

01:14.810 --> 01:16.270
out there.

01:16.300 --> 01:20.710
We first have re-act router and that is for routing.

01:20.890 --> 01:29.080
So changing pages and changing routes in our RL It's pretty much the standard when it comes to any reactant

01:29.080 --> 01:30.190
redux project.

01:30.520 --> 01:32.930
So highly highly recommended.

01:33.100 --> 01:35.010
Very easy to use.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.650
Very easy to learn as well.

01:36.700 --> 01:39.640
I'll take you a day and you can pick it off fairly easily.

01:41.160 --> 01:49.650
You also have things like utility libraries and these are libraries that add to the current javascript

01:49.770 --> 01:52.440
tools that you get out of the box.

01:52.440 --> 01:56.740
So think of it as how it functions to javascript.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.720
The most popular are Ramdass.

01:58.810 --> 02:06.080
If you want to really keep the functional programming ideology a really really good library and there's

02:06.100 --> 02:16.690
also the most popular low dash which again gives you actual tools that you can use with javascript you'll

02:16.820 --> 02:20.570
want to think about styling with it react.

02:20.630 --> 02:27.380
And again there's a number of tools that people use for styling there's glamorous which I really really

02:27.380 --> 02:28.170
like.

02:28.250 --> 02:35.480
There's styled components which again is very nice and quite similar to glamorous.

02:35.570 --> 02:38.520
And then there's things like CSSA modules.

02:38.630 --> 02:46.490
Let's say these three are probably the best to use if you want to tack on a smarter way to deal with

02:46.580 --> 02:47.830
styles and react.

02:47.870 --> 02:50.300
And again these are quite easy to pick up.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.720
You can spend a day on them and get the hang of it.

02:53.860 --> 02:57.490
Next we have something called the cats be dodgy.

02:58.060 --> 03:02.980
And this is really really good for static web sites in react.

03:02.980 --> 03:06.340
So that is simple tax based websites.

03:06.460 --> 03:08.920
Actually if you go to the re-act documentation

03:18.840 --> 03:28.110
their documentation is actually served with gaspy dodgiest because well they're just simple tasks spaced

03:28.860 --> 03:29.640
pages.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.310
That works really really well.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.710
Then there's also next door.

03:35.750 --> 03:41.510
AJ Yes extremely popular for server side rendered apps.

03:41.740 --> 03:45.490
And that's something that we'll talk about when we get to the server side section and we'll actually

03:45.490 --> 03:52.330
build a simple Next Slide G-S up but very popular and I highly recommend if you're building anything

03:52.330 --> 04:00.040
server side next probably what re-act is known for and I just picked two options here but there are

04:00.040 --> 04:01.230
so many out there.

04:01.230 --> 04:05.920
Re-act is really really good because we're able to build reusable components.

04:05.970 --> 04:12.270
So if I build a really cool calendar component I can put it online and other people can just grab that

04:12.270 --> 04:15.800
component and use it in their projects as well.

04:16.770 --> 04:23.610
So some of the bigger ones are material material UI components that again you can just use.

04:23.820 --> 04:33.940
And there's also the semantic UI library that has a ton of Riak components that you can use.

04:34.050 --> 04:41.760
Again another awesome reason to use reactor's these components that people share and you can just add

04:41.760 --> 04:44.510
on to your website.

04:44.670 --> 04:49.810
And then finally there's tools then make redux better more efficient.

04:49.980 --> 04:56.310
You have things like we select They you'll see in most redox projects that help with something called

04:56.310 --> 05:01.620
selectors and improve the performance of your apps.

05:01.650 --> 05:09.240
You also have things like redux saga which which handles asynchronous actions and redux.

05:09.240 --> 05:16.080
So think of it as a redux thank bought supercharged So as things get more and more complex you have

05:16.080 --> 05:18.510
more and more asynchronous actions.

05:18.510 --> 05:23.040
You might want to start looking at things such as re-asked saga.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.840
It is a little bit complicated to learn it first.

05:26.100 --> 05:28.500
And there's people that love it and hate it.

05:28.500 --> 05:32.650
But definitely something that tries to solve the problem Wolf.

05:32.670 --> 05:36.200
What do we do when we start getting bigger and bigger and bigger apps.

05:36.510 --> 05:43.950
And then you also have something like immutable J.S. that you can use as a library to make sure that

05:43.950 --> 05:49.260
your state remains immutable and enforce that among your developer teams.

05:50.300 --> 05:57.310
Now I don't expect you to know every single one of these and use every single one of these in your projects.

05:58.420 --> 06:04.510
As a matter of fact I want to caution against them and every time you add something ask yourself Do

06:04.510 --> 06:05.710
I really need it.

06:05.710 --> 06:08.390
What's the benefit that I'm getting out of this.

06:09.640 --> 06:17.020
Because adding any library to our project adds extra weight adds extra javascript that we need to deliver

06:17.020 --> 06:17.960
to the client.

06:18.340 --> 06:26.140
So make sure if you're adding any of these things that you have a justifiable reason that actually improves

06:26.230 --> 06:29.370
the value of your product.

06:30.290 --> 06:32.820
And it also helps with the development.

06:32.840 --> 06:38.930
So when you think of value you don't just think customers and users also think of developer teams and

06:38.930 --> 06:44.970
people you work with are they going to benefit if you add immutable G-S to your codebase.

06:45.260 --> 06:52.730
Or is the actual learning curve and the frustration that developers might have by using immutable worth

06:53.060 --> 06:57.170
the safeguards that it might add to your project.

06:58.010 --> 07:05.780
But anyway I wanted to emphasize that as a senior developer always consider pros and cons whether you

07:05.780 --> 07:13.940
need something and if you do need something really analyze what is the best tool for the job.

07:13.940 --> 07:15.280
I feel like a broken record.

07:15.290 --> 07:22.700
I've said this numerous times but it is a really important concept so dont just add immutable jazz because

07:22.880 --> 07:26.470
you read it in a blog post then everybody's raving about it.

07:26.480 --> 07:32.480
Each project is different so you need to be able to make those decisions for yourself for your project

07:32.510 --> 07:33.940
for your developer team.

07:35.690 --> 07:40.100
All right enough talking for me I see in the next one Buh-Bye.
