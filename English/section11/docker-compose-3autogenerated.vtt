00:00.650 --> 00:06.860
Welcome back I wanted to show you some quick commands that haven't had the time to go over in the last

00:06.860 --> 00:07.730
video.

00:08.180 --> 00:13.940
For example if I want to exit out of here I need to also bring down the containers and the way I can

00:13.940 --> 00:19.880
do that is by running docker compose and instead of up we simply run down.

00:20.900 --> 00:27.180
And that's going to remove our containers if I ran Daker compose up now

00:32.950 --> 00:37.000
we see that it's running because we've already built it.

00:37.010 --> 00:43.650
However we still need to call up in order to have access to.

00:43.810 --> 00:50.880
There's also another command the docker compose and then the run which we've talked about smart brain

00:50.880 --> 00:53.350
API which all run the container.

00:53.370 --> 01:05.820
But we can also say instead of run we can use doc or compose exec for execute and now we execute with

01:05.820 --> 01:11.600
the bash command that is we want to enter the bash of smart brain API.

01:11.790 --> 01:15.720
And I see that there's no container because I haven't run it yet.

01:15.780 --> 01:19.120
So let's run it in the background so we can do it from this terminal.

01:19.380 --> 01:26.090
Again Iran Dr. compose up doing Dharker compose up with Dashti.

01:26.230 --> 01:28.030
So it's going to happen in the background.

01:28.060 --> 01:33.220
And now I hear Ron the exec smart brain Bash and look at that.

01:33.280 --> 01:37.760
I'm in the back of our container.

01:37.900 --> 01:39.370
Very cool.

01:39.370 --> 01:42.600
And there's tons more commands that you can use.

01:42.610 --> 01:44.710
They have great documentation online.

01:44.740 --> 01:46.030
I recommend you check them out.

01:46.030 --> 01:50.970
But you've covered that significant want that you're really going to use in your day today.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.140
I'll see you in the next one.

01:52.630 --> 01:52.900
But by.
