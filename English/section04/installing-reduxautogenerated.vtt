WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:05.650
And a welcome back we know how the rubble friends app works.

00:05.660 --> 00:14.330
Now with three act that's great but Bruno asked us a specific thing we need to add redux to our robo

00:14.330 --> 00:20.860
friends app so that it can scale well and handle state management better.

00:22.630 --> 00:28.960
Now would these next videos were going to work together step by step.

00:28.990 --> 00:34.630
I'm going to show you how redux is implemented and how it works and you're going to be following along

00:35.170 --> 00:38.320
trying to make sure that your code works as well.

00:38.770 --> 00:42.120
All right so take a pause now and get your environment set up.

00:42.140 --> 00:46.470
Speaking code along with me you're all set.

00:46.510 --> 00:46.940
All right.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.300
And we're going to get started.

00:48.370 --> 00:56.360
The first thing I'm going to do is I have my robot friends up so I'm going to clone this Ribault and

00:56.360 --> 01:06.650
we'll just do our regular set up with get clone and then I'm going to CD into my robot friends perfect.

01:06.690 --> 01:09.510
Let's open this up in your text editor

01:14.630 --> 01:18.720
and again I love joining these together so it looks nice.

01:19.470 --> 01:20.670
And clean.

01:20.720 --> 01:21.250
Perfect.

01:22.670 --> 01:29.510
Now obviously the first thing we need to do when we clone something is and then install to make sure

01:29.510 --> 01:32.710
we have all the packages.

01:32.920 --> 01:38.970
And we also want to make sure that everything is running smoothly without any errors whatsoever.

01:39.190 --> 01:48.410
So the next step is going to be to run NPM start.

01:48.460 --> 01:49.180
All right.

01:49.180 --> 01:49.690
Perfect.

01:49.690 --> 01:50.930
Everything is working.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.780
And we should be able to filter.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.420
Perfect.

01:56.430 --> 01:56.690
All right.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.790
So we're familiar with this codebase.

02:01.120 --> 02:09.990
We have our re-act up but that's it just a simple re-act up with containers and components.

02:10.040 --> 02:19.690
The very first thing we would want to do is install redux so I'm going to close this and Iran MBM install

02:20.480 --> 02:20.930
redux

02:23.740 --> 02:30.990
this redux package will give us some tools in order to incorporate redox into our reactor.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.840
But here's the cool part.

02:33.840 --> 02:37.630
With the redox package and why I'm such a big fan.

02:38.690 --> 02:45.680
It's that 90 percent of your code is still going to be Javascript redux is going to give you a few helpers

02:46.070 --> 02:48.620
but you're still writing javascript.

02:48.740 --> 02:52.280
It's still improving your javascript skills.

02:52.280 --> 02:57.470
When you write redux and it teaches really really good principles which is why I'm such a big fan of

02:57.530 --> 03:05.630
the library you might not always need redux in your projects but it is just a good good tool to learn

03:05.960 --> 03:13.070
because it has such great concepts that you'll use throughout your career.

03:13.220 --> 03:19.010
Now the second thing we need and this is something similar with re-act remember how we installed the

03:19.010 --> 03:25.730
re-act package and then we also needed something called the re-act dorm package to connect react to

03:25.730 --> 03:29.130
the dong well in similar fashion.

03:29.140 --> 03:38.770
We need to connect redux to react because redux theoretically could work with any other library by adding

03:38.980 --> 03:40.240
another package.

03:40.300 --> 03:46.600
We can again let re-act know that hey we're going to be using redox with you.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.050
So that's very easy to do.

03:48.070 --> 03:53.080
We'll just NPM install and the package is called re-act

03:59.260 --> 04:06.570
and the way this re-act redux is going to work is that it's going to connect only the containers.

04:06.760 --> 04:14.410
So in this case APTA J.S. to the what we call a redux store or that big javascript object we're talking

04:14.410 --> 04:14.820
about.

04:14.860 --> 04:21.110
That describes the state over at and they're going to communicate the container is going to communicate

04:21.200 --> 04:23.770
with the store and vice versa.

04:24.900 --> 04:31.410
Now the other components what we call dumb or presentational components.

04:31.530 --> 04:34.250
Know that redux exists.

04:34.320 --> 04:41.010
The only connection is going to be between something called a container or a smart component and the

04:41.100 --> 04:42.650
redux store.

04:42.660 --> 04:44.130
So let me show you what I mean.

04:45.280 --> 04:51.040
If you remember this diagram we just installed the redux package which you can think of it as being

04:51.040 --> 04:51.990
over here.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.300
This red box that allows us to create a store and a couple of other help functions.

04:58.300 --> 05:10.310
We also downloaded re-act redux which allows us to connect these two pieces and react redux is able

05:10.310 --> 05:17.090
to be used in order to say hey we want the celo components to be aware that we're using redux and to

05:17.090 --> 05:20.650
get their state from the redux store.

05:22.380 --> 05:28.020
So just think of this diagram as we're working through it all we're doing is essentially connecting

05:28.020 --> 05:30.710
these two libraries together.

05:30.770 --> 05:37.630
All right so now that we have these two packages we can start importing them and using it within our

05:37.630 --> 05:43.660
shop but that's for the next couple of the videos I'll see in the next one.

05:43.770 --> 05:44.010
Buh-Bye.
