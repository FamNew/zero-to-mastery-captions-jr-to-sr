Pay court or it's Bruno here.

00:03.520 --> 00:10.040
Hey listen we've been getting some complaints that some of the users can see other user information.

00:10.060 --> 00:16.290
And I think we need a secure way to manage sessions on our smart brain up.

00:16.300 --> 00:17.330
Can you help us with that.

00:18.610 --> 00:19.370
Nice.

00:19.390 --> 00:23.900
Thanks Cotai by the way.

00:23.900 --> 00:24.730
All right.

00:24.890 --> 00:33.380
We're going to get into a topic that is going to run the next couple of sections and it is a big topic

00:33.380 --> 00:39.230
but we're going to be using different tools in order to implement what Bruno asked us to do and that

00:39.230 --> 00:42.910
is a secure way to manage sessions.

00:43.070 --> 00:50.660
That is how can I make sure that when a user signs in and they refresh a page they're still able to

00:50.660 --> 00:51.940
stay signed in.

00:52.010 --> 00:57.700
They don't have to constantly sign into our app every single time they come back to it.

00:58.810 --> 01:00.880
Especially if they have their browsers open.

01:01.060 --> 01:05.790
And we also don't want other people to see other users profile.

01:06.680 --> 01:13.380
It's a problem that everybody needs to solve when creating an app especially an app that has users.

01:13.610 --> 01:17.540
You have to manage sessions and over the next couple sections.

01:17.570 --> 01:18.800
This is what we're going to do.

01:18.830 --> 01:20.900
We're going to implement sessions.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.030
It's going to be a fun one Southsea inside.
