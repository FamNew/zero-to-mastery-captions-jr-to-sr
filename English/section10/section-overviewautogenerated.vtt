00:01.990 --> 00:11.730
Welcome back to a special bonus section and the extra bits and we're going to talk about code analysis.

00:11.770 --> 00:19.210
You see most of the time as developers you will be starting working on projects right from the very

00:19.210 --> 00:20.210
beginning.

00:20.230 --> 00:27.150
I mean it's very rare that you're there at the beginning setting up the original folder structures in

00:27.150 --> 00:28.870
code and web pack.

00:29.230 --> 00:36.100
Most of the time if you are working at a large company they usually already have a project that they've

00:36.100 --> 00:39.020
been building and you are told.

00:39.070 --> 00:39.560
All right.

00:40.500 --> 00:41.520
Go grab the files.

00:41.550 --> 00:43.660
Go grab the code and get started.

00:44.460 --> 00:51.700
You have to start reviewing the code analyzing it and figuring out how everything works.

00:52.080 --> 01:00.380
But just looking at the code and maybe some documentation made by your coworkers in this section we're

01:00.380 --> 01:06.920
going to use the smart brain up an app that we built from scratch in my previous course the complete

01:06.920 --> 01:08.790
web developer zero to mastery.

01:09.950 --> 01:16.770
In this course we're going to be adding a ton of more features to it like we would in real life.

01:17.150 --> 01:22.730
We're going to add multiple face detections we're going to create user profiles and the ability to save

01:22.760 --> 01:29.780
and modify user profiles adding sessions for management adding dock containers for our development and

01:29.780 --> 01:37.650
much much more but in order for us to do that we have to analyze the codebase and understand what is

01:37.650 --> 01:38.530
going on.

01:39.430 --> 01:45.190
In the next video I'm going to take you through my process when I first start working on a project that

01:45.190 --> 01:53.010
has already been started before I've arrived and this is an important skill that is often overlooked.

01:53.810 --> 02:01.350
Our senior developers we can walk through code logically and get caught up on how things work so that

02:01.440 --> 02:04.530
we can start contributing right away to the project.

02:04.530 --> 02:10.650
We can take a high level view and understand how each piece fits together and we're going to learn how

02:10.650 --> 02:12.340
to do that in this section.

02:13.230 --> 02:20.000
Then we're going to implement the new multiple face detection feature as Bruno requests it.

02:20.120 --> 02:25.010
We're going to follow best practices for making pull request to contribute to projects and do a lot

02:25.010 --> 02:26.260
of fun things.

02:26.450 --> 02:28.040
So shall we get started.

02:28.250 --> 02:35.720
Well before we do I just want to give you a heads up setting up a current project on your machine is

02:35.720 --> 02:37.540
going to be frustrating.

02:37.610 --> 02:44.290
You're going to have to set up your database server and client and I'm going to show you how to do this.

02:44.480 --> 02:50.510
But because we all have different machines different laptops different operating system it's going to

02:50.510 --> 02:57.020
be really really frustrating and there's going to be times where you have to google around or you might

02:57.020 --> 03:04.190
have errors that you don't understand and I do this on purpose because this is so common in the industry.

03:04.490 --> 03:10.790
But I'm going to show you how to set up this entire project and in the upcoming sections we're going

03:10.790 --> 03:16.460
to use this example of how frustrating it was to set up everything the database the server the client

03:17.270 --> 03:23.050
and then use docker and show you why daquiri is so amazing and why it solves this problem.

03:23.810 --> 03:26.360
Because it makes this process super easy.

03:26.360 --> 03:34.550
But before I do that and just dive you into docker you must understand the frustration so be forewarned.

03:34.570 --> 03:41.320
I'm going to give resources during this section so that this project works on all operating systems

03:41.710 --> 03:48.520
but use this as a way for you to practice something that you'd have to do when you start as a web developer

03:48.700 --> 03:51.340
and you company.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.700
Let's get started showing.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.000
I'll see in the next one.
