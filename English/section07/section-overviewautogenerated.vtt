00:01.590 --> 00:08.160
In this section we're going to talk about a tool that is becoming increasingly popular in javascript

00:08.160 --> 00:10.750
land typescript.

00:10.920 --> 00:19.470
What is typescript before we understand that we must first learn about the types of programming language

00:19.500 --> 00:21.140
that we have.

00:21.240 --> 00:24.940
That is because time script changes.

00:24.990 --> 00:28.800
One of the fundamental concepts of javascript.

00:28.800 --> 00:37.780
It makes javascript which is a dynamically typed language into a language that is static typed.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.070
What does that mean.

00:39.840 --> 00:46.180
In this section we're going to learn about the idea of static typing versus dynamic typing.

00:46.210 --> 00:52.370
We'll show you some of the tools that allow us to use static typing which might be useful.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.410
And also talk about some of its downsides.

00:57.670 --> 01:03.980
We're then going to learn typescript by actually writing it and we're going to finish off this section

01:04.010 --> 01:09.580
by actually adding typescript to our robo friends up and at the end.

01:09.710 --> 01:15.100
We're finally going to be able to tell Brunow what we think of typescript and whether we should add

01:15.100 --> 01:18.670
it to our robo friends project or not.

01:18.860 --> 01:20.270
It's going to be another fun one.

01:20.360 --> 01:23.810
So let's get started and see you inside.
