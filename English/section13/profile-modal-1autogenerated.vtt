00:00.920 --> 00:09.050
Walk back we've had a nice set up here where we now have a profile icon and we can sign out or view

00:09.050 --> 00:12.870
profile well or at least we can click on it.

00:13.010 --> 00:15.690
But there's no view profile functionality.

00:15.800 --> 00:16.970
We can sign out.

00:17.090 --> 00:23.810
But when I click View Profile nothing happens now or we're going to try and do is when we click View

00:23.810 --> 00:28.810
profile I think it would be nice if we had a model that pops up.

00:29.330 --> 00:36.680
And this model allows us to change our name maybe change other fields in our profile and have it update

00:36.740 --> 00:37.390
accordingly.

00:37.490 --> 00:40.710
Maybe have our name updated right in here.

00:42.490 --> 00:43.320
So let's do that.

00:43.420 --> 00:47.940
Let's build a component that creates a model for us.

00:48.400 --> 00:53.800
Luckily for us re-act came up with a new feature called create portal.

00:53.800 --> 00:58.450
You see modals in general and apps are very very common.

00:58.870 --> 01:06.280
And there has been an issue previously where we didn't have portals and it was a big problem of how

01:06.280 --> 01:11.170
to set up models in a way that works really well with re-act.

01:11.210 --> 01:16.490
Now with the introduction of portals this has become really really easy and they have a really really

01:16.490 --> 01:17.710
nice documentation.

01:17.810 --> 01:21.610
If you want to read more about it and really nice code snippets as well.

01:21.980 --> 01:26.990
We're going to build our own model here that it contains the profile so that when we click on the profile

01:26.990 --> 01:30.940
page or view profile we'll actually get this model.

01:30.980 --> 01:33.400
So let's get to working.

01:33.540 --> 01:38.030
The first thing I want to do is go back to the index dodgiest file.

01:38.070 --> 01:41.260
I'm going to close some of these things just to keep things clean.

01:42.780 --> 01:43.310
OK.

01:43.560 --> 01:52.290
Now the way modals work is that we want to make sure that we have a nother re-act render that is outside

01:52.290 --> 01:55.670
of the app and that's the cool thing about portals.

01:55.850 --> 02:02.300
You can have a portal that is completely separate from the app and a number of re-act Dom render.

02:02.310 --> 02:13.350
So think of it as another react on render that can be called let's say modal and by using the re-act

02:13.380 --> 02:19.720
create portal we can actually transfer prop's in between them which is really cool.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.080
It's kind of like well a portal.

02:22.170 --> 02:24.050
And that's why it's called Portal.

02:24.060 --> 02:31.650
So what we want to do is create another HMO element that we combined the modal component to.

02:31.860 --> 02:32.610
Let's get to it.

02:33.900 --> 02:42.870
The first thing I'm going to do is go back to my public folder where my index got a files and if I scroll

02:42.870 --> 02:46.090
down here we see that we have divides of root.

02:46.110 --> 02:53.030
That is where re-act is binding and rendering everything but down here I want to create a modal portal

02:54.130 --> 03:03.110
and I can say div ID and we'll call it whatever we want let's say modal.

03:03.240 --> 03:09.000
And again I like this demonstration because it shows how re-act works and how you can extend the functionality

03:09.000 --> 03:10.890
of re-act.

03:10.900 --> 03:17.950
So now we've created another thing that we can bind our mortal to and by using create portal we can

03:17.950 --> 03:23.740
just make sure that whatever's in the app the props passed down to whatever's in the motorcade route

03:23.860 --> 03:24.580
as well.

03:24.640 --> 03:29.040
Let's say that and go back to our apt.

03:30.710 --> 03:31.700
Now in app.

03:31.730 --> 03:38.140
Yes let's say that we're going to import another component that we haven't created yet but we will soon.

03:38.420 --> 03:47.210
And this is going to be the modal component and we're going to import it from our components folder

03:48.080 --> 03:54.330
and it's just going to be called motile or let's create a modal folder.

03:56.610 --> 04:02.450
And I get a bit of an error because well we haven't created the modal components yet.

04:02.460 --> 04:02.750
All right.

04:02.790 --> 04:03.760
Let's do that.

04:03.810 --> 04:08.920
I want to go into components create a new folder we'll call it motile.

04:09.480 --> 04:16.880
And within the modal folder I know we're getting a bit repetitive here but that's fine for now.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.270
Modal dodgiest

04:20.880 --> 04:23.720
And let's start building out this Modal component.
