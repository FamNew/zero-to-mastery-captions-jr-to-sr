Hey it's Bruno here.

00:02.840 --> 00:07.270
Really appreciate the work that you've put in for typescript and you know what.

00:07.310 --> 00:09.260
I completely agree with your decision.

00:09.260 --> 00:14.240
Thanks for teaching me about the library and what we should do to our project again.

00:14.310 --> 00:15.200
You were awesome.

00:15.290 --> 00:16.430
Really thankful.

00:16.430 --> 00:18.630
And looking forward to our next project.

00:18.650 --> 00:20.560
It's going to be another good one.

00:22.050 --> 00:24.990
All right we finished another section.

00:25.200 --> 00:30.600
I think one of the top a section in discourse if you've made it this far.

00:30.600 --> 00:31.760
Good job.

00:31.920 --> 00:35.240
I hope you had fun learning typescript.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.810
I do want to know how you found it.

00:38.650 --> 00:47.880
But here's my take on it and here's what I would do with typescript especially for Kaikohe Corp. typescript.

00:48.050 --> 00:56.510
100 percent reduces errors in our production reduces bugs and it's definitely useful.

00:56.530 --> 01:01.780
However that doesn't mean that we should automatically include it.

01:01.780 --> 01:09.580
We already know by now because I've said it so many times that everything has pros and cons and in this

01:09.580 --> 01:17.200
example I wanted to demonstrate that we don't necessarily need to add something just because it promises

01:17.200 --> 01:22.620
a new feature or is attractive and is currently a hot topic.

01:22.750 --> 01:31.030
As a senior developer your job is not to keep tacking on cool new tools and new paradigms to your project.

01:31.180 --> 01:39.820
As a senior developer you have to look at your development environment your team your developers your

01:39.820 --> 01:47.040
company your project what are its goals and what is the best use of your time.

01:47.440 --> 01:52.870
Your developer's time and also what will provide the greatest value.

01:53.260 --> 01:59.090
In the case of cakehole Corp. They benefit from having unit tests good unit tests.

01:59.110 --> 02:07.870
Make sure our code runs well but with a smaller developer team perhaps they're better off working on

02:08.200 --> 02:15.070
features that increase their development versus adding a little bit more safety when it comes to bugs.

02:15.160 --> 02:22.750
With something like typescript and maybe it will frustrate some of their developers to learn something

02:22.750 --> 02:23.140
new.

02:23.140 --> 02:30.820
On top of javascript so you as a senior developer decided that for this project typescript is not the

02:30.820 --> 02:38.500
best decision you trust your developers that don't make the right decisions and you also value your

02:38.500 --> 02:44.200
time developing new features as well because Kaikohe Corp. is a fast growing company.

02:45.030 --> 02:52.300
So that's the decision that you made your decision was to perhaps not included this time around.

02:52.340 --> 02:56.830
It's a tough decision and you have to make those decision based on the situation.

02:56.970 --> 03:04.280
And I hope you learned that not to hate typescript or love typescript but to understand how a tool can

03:04.280 --> 03:12.860
benefit you and also how to say no sometimes to all the requests that you may get from your bosses your

03:12.860 --> 03:17.050
partners or your customers.

03:17.070 --> 03:19.010
It's all about tradeoff people.

03:19.110 --> 03:20.800
So I hope you had fun.

03:20.820 --> 03:22.190
I hope you learned a lot.

03:22.890 --> 03:24.770
And I'll see you in the next section.
