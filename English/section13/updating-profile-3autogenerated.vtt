00:01.130 --> 00:04.970
All right we're getting so close I can almost see the end.

00:05.030 --> 00:13.880
So let's finally get the save button to work so that we can update our user information.

00:13.920 --> 00:19.350
I'm going to go back to my front end and I'm actually going to move this here so I don't have to keep

00:19.440 --> 00:25.210
seeing the back end code and within here I want to create a new method.

00:25.370 --> 00:31.670
I'm once again going to just make this a little bit smaller so it's cleaner and I'm going to create

00:31.670 --> 00:40.310
a new method called on profile change or let's call it arm profile update.

00:40.650 --> 00:46.520
And this is going to receive some sort of data and this data.

00:46.970 --> 00:56.650
Well we're going to do exactly what the back end expects us to do that is to fetch our HTP localhost

00:57.910 --> 01:04.390
port three thousand where we have our doctor container and we're going to do a profile and we want to

01:04.390 --> 01:11.870
give it some sort of an idea well we can just do Templi strengths instead of strengths here and change

01:11.860 --> 01:21.830
changes to dollar sign Kerley back brackets and end here do our users Id remember we get our eyes props

01:22.010 --> 01:29.840
the user object that includes the ID so we can just simply say stop prop's user Daut Heidi.

01:29.870 --> 01:33.770
So whatever idea of the user is that's the one that we want to post to.

01:33.980 --> 01:41.760
And the way we post to fetch is we have to actually tell it because otherwise the default is get.

01:42.080 --> 01:49.570
So the second parameter is going to be an object that has method of post.

01:49.720 --> 01:52.270
We're going to give it the headers

01:57.540 --> 01:59.250
content type

02:02.120 --> 02:08.390
and we're going to give it Jaison So we're going to say application Jaison because we're sending on

02:08.660 --> 02:19.710
Jason data and the body as we'll see and like we discussed the Jason string ify.

02:19.750 --> 02:23.470
So we're turning everything into a string and what are we turning into a string.

02:23.530 --> 02:32.340
Well we're going to return for and put with the data that the function receives.

02:32.350 --> 02:38.350
So the body's going to send four men but as the object that contains all the data that the back end

02:38.350 --> 02:40.510
expects which is name age.

02:40.690 --> 02:48.290
And Pat let's do a dot then here that's going to receive a response

02:51.520 --> 02:55.920
after this post call and we'll say that what should we do.

02:56.780 --> 03:02.370
Well first thing we want to do is definitely toggle the modal.

03:02.610 --> 03:03.830
We want to turn it off.

03:03.840 --> 03:14.410
Now remember we received that as part of the props and we also want to run the load user function that

03:14.410 --> 03:18.180
we have in the app.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.230
Now what does the load user do again.

03:20.410 --> 03:29.090
If you go back to Apogee Apogees we see that the load a user function which gets run right off to resign

03:29.460 --> 03:37.600
simply sets the state of the user object that gets returned and we simply need to pass it some data

03:38.770 --> 03:40.560
that includes these things.

03:40.600 --> 03:48.580
So in our case we can just do a nice shorthand way with spread operator I can say this dot props dot

03:48.580 --> 03:53.320
user whatever we've had before so we get to keep the idea of the user.

03:53.350 --> 03:59.980
Remember the props include the user id and then we're also going to on top of that any updates that

04:00.040 --> 04:03.060
may include within the data that is within the form.

04:03.070 --> 04:05.790
So it's going to overwrite whatever is in the user object.

04:05.860 --> 04:07.380
Maybe the age got changed.

04:07.390 --> 04:15.240
In that case it's going to overwrite whatever's in this prop's user and we create this object.

04:15.460 --> 04:15.700
Right.

04:15.700 --> 04:20.270
And then finally a super nice catch.

04:20.450 --> 04:26.330
And for now we'll just do a console log moment of truth would save everything.

04:26.330 --> 04:29.290
See if this actually works.

04:30.090 --> 04:35.850
Well first things first make sure that we pass load user and we have access to Loew's user and the prova

04:36.490 --> 04:37.910
for go back to APT.

04:38.060 --> 04:38.660
Yes.

04:40.790 --> 04:41.690
Profile.

04:41.890 --> 04:42.990
Doesn't have load user.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.880
So let's pass that.

04:44.890 --> 04:54.340
If we go back or and here we can just say load user is going to be this dot load user let's save go

04:54.340 --> 04:59.110
back sign in once again for the millionth time.

05:00.830 --> 05:04.390
Go to the profile.

05:04.640 --> 05:08.760
And I just realized we forgot to do something didn't we plan.

05:08.770 --> 05:15.700
We clicked the sign in button while we need to actually call the on profile update don't we.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.220
That's the most important part.

05:17.260 --> 05:18.300
So let's do that.

05:19.290 --> 05:20.940
I'm going to scroll all the way down.

05:21.150 --> 05:23.040
Open up whatever we're rendering.

05:23.050 --> 05:25.980
Scroll all the way down to the save button.

05:26.310 --> 05:31.230
And here in the Save button let's do a on click function.

05:31.530 --> 05:40.470
And this on click is going to have this dot on profile update.

05:40.470 --> 05:41.460
And we're going to pass it.

05:41.500 --> 05:45.800
Name age and pet.

05:45.920 --> 05:51.020
And if we go up we see that the user is props and this can get confusing.

05:51.020 --> 05:53.950
We don't want the props we want whatever the state is.

05:53.960 --> 05:58.150
So this state which is name Asian pet.

05:58.190 --> 05:59.560
So let's pass that on.

05:59.570 --> 06:03.400
I'm going to say this state.

06:03.560 --> 06:04.020
All right.

06:04.090 --> 06:05.840
I don't really like the way this looks.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.960
This should be something cleaner and more descriptive.

06:09.140 --> 06:15.200
So let's come up here and say Konst name age.

06:15.390 --> 06:22.470
Pat is going to be called Stop props or this start state because we're only interested in the state

06:22.860 --> 06:30.890
that the form has been filled with and and here instead of this state we can just use destructuring

06:30.890 --> 06:37.270
and say name age prop's because it's expecting a data object.

06:37.370 --> 06:40.550
And again we're not calling the function here.

06:40.550 --> 06:43.960
We want to assign the function to the on click event.

06:44.240 --> 06:48.290
So once again just assigning the function like this.

06:48.650 --> 06:54.930
Let's save and we have some issues and no not props.

06:54.940 --> 06:57.430
We want Pat here.

06:58.860 --> 07:02.590
Let's save go back seinen.

07:02.830 --> 07:07.200
Once again moment of truth here.

07:07.250 --> 07:08.720
Hopefully everything works.

07:08.720 --> 07:15.160
I changed my name to hey with some exclamation marks and I'm going to just click we get can't answer

07:15.170 --> 07:18.020
whatever we want here but we're not doing anything on the database.

07:18.070 --> 07:21.000
Monday click save o.

07:21.020 --> 07:27.320
Lee Moli our moto closed and our user was loaded with the new name.

07:27.470 --> 07:28.680
Congratulations.

07:28.700 --> 07:31.740
We just were able to update our profile.

07:32.910 --> 07:40.010
And now every time let's say I sign out and I sign back in again.

07:40.230 --> 07:41.500
My name's in the database.

07:41.510 --> 07:46.880
It's now hey with very exclamation or very excited exclamation marks.

07:47.220 --> 07:49.260
Very very nice.

07:50.190 --> 07:50.970
All right.

07:51.090 --> 07:57.540
We've done all of this for the sole purpose of demonstrating sessions but with our profile without some

07:57.540 --> 08:03.080
sort of a necessary user information it's hard to demonstrate why we need sessions.

08:03.180 --> 08:07.230
But now finally I know it's long overdue.

08:07.230 --> 08:12.270
We're going to learn about sessions and implemented in here I'll see in the next one.

08:12.550 --> 08:12.810
Babai.
