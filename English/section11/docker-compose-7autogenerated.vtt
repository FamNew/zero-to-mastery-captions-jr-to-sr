00:00.660 --> 00:01.740
Welcome back.

00:01.740 --> 00:07.680
There's one last thing I want to show you one little trick and that is wouldn't it be nice if we had

00:07.680 --> 00:14.700
some sort of seed data within these tables so that we we run docker compose a bill that there is already

00:14.700 --> 00:17.400
some users that we can start testing with.

00:17.820 --> 00:21.860
And that is a very common case when working on a project.

00:21.900 --> 00:24.650
So let's do that in this video.

00:24.690 --> 00:34.730
All we need to do is create another command and this time after we've created the log in and the users

00:34.730 --> 00:45.840
table we're going to create a command and this command is going to run another obscure statement.

00:45.840 --> 00:51.700
That's called seed and that's going to be in the seed folder.

00:51.720 --> 01:02.800
Once again we create another folder called seed and we hear the new file again coaling get seed.

01:02.880 --> 01:10.410
Eskew well and this seed that SU all is going to do a simple skew all steam.

01:10.720 --> 01:11.950
It's going to insert

01:15.350 --> 01:23.750
into the users table the name email and trees.

01:24.260 --> 01:26.320
And let's just say Joynt as well.

01:29.460 --> 01:33.460
And it's going to enter the values.

01:33.490 --> 01:40.110
Let's go with Tim as the name email is going to be.

01:40.250 --> 01:49.700
Or let's change this up let's go with Jesse e-mails going to be Jesse at gmail dot com

01:52.500 --> 02:00.810
and trees is just going to be let's say five entries and the date joined is just going to be 2018.

02:01.130 --> 02:03.650
Let's go with January 1st

02:07.970 --> 02:19.070
and again just to make sure let's just do a began transaction and a commit at the end.

02:20.750 --> 02:30.150
We're also wanted to insert into the log and table because they need to log in as well and this log

02:30.140 --> 02:32.040
in table is going to accept Passhe

02:34.690 --> 02:35.480
and an email

02:39.190 --> 02:40.180
and the values

02:44.010 --> 02:48.120
are going to be this little hash that actually already checked.

02:48.120 --> 02:54.450
So this hash with the crypt is just password A.

02:54.960 --> 03:02.520
So as long as you put the letter you'll be able to log in and his Jessy's email is going to be Jessee

03:02.610 --> 03:04.120
at gmail dot com

03:07.950 --> 03:08.600
perfect.

03:08.730 --> 03:14.730
And the very last thing we need to do and obviously you can imagine if we want to add more users more

03:15.030 --> 03:19.930
information more data we can always just keep adding onto this seat file.

03:20.210 --> 03:23.430
But for now just to test make sure that this is all right.

03:23.430 --> 03:35.630
The last thing we need to do is in the docker file we want to add a nother folder called seed and add

03:35.630 --> 03:38.350
whatever files are in the seed folder.

03:39.510 --> 03:42.550
Once again let's close this up.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.980
Bring everything down and rebuild everything

03:54.310 --> 03:55.120
we scroll up.

03:55.130 --> 03:59.950
OK we see like oh yeah we have two answers that happened that's a good sign.

04:01.280 --> 04:08.900
And if we go back now to our app and sign out let's see if we can sign in with Jessy's information.

04:08.900 --> 04:17.970
So is Jesse at gmail dot com and the e-mail was just the letter A look of that we're able to log in

04:17.970 --> 04:19.770
to Jesse's account.

04:19.890 --> 04:21.330
That is a test account.

04:21.390 --> 04:25.870
The entries count is already 5 and everything is working.

04:25.950 --> 04:35.190
We're able to connect and we're also able to seed our database our test database already.

04:35.330 --> 04:41.210
And I wanted to show you this just to show you what you can do with Dr. Phil. You can keep adding things

04:41.210 --> 04:46.780
you can do different commands but it should make sense now how everything is working.

04:47.970 --> 04:53.010
In the next video we're going to review everything and make sure that we understand how each of these

04:53.010 --> 04:54.680
pieces connected.

04:54.750 --> 04:59.520
I know that there was a lot of information that I threw where you and this is a section that you might

04:59.520 --> 05:05.640
have to visit a couple of times but keep in mind that we want to connect these dots here and in the

05:05.640 --> 05:10.670
next video I'm going to try and help you finalize and solidify that knowledge.

05:10.890 --> 05:12.740
I'll see that one by.
