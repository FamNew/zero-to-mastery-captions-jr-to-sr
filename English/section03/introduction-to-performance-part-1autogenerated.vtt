One of the first things you will realize as a web developer is that the Internet speeds vary for everybody.

00:09.830 --> 00:13.440
And people don't have time to wait for your web site to load.

00:13.490 --> 00:16.560
Performance is very very important.

00:17.690 --> 00:25.280
All big companies prioritize Fast User experience because they know that people today are used to not

00:25.370 --> 00:34.810
waiting around Amazon calculated that on their Web site if a page load slows down just one second that

00:34.810 --> 00:39.040
could cost them 1.6 billion in sales each year.

00:39.040 --> 00:46.060
Google so did a calculation and by slowing its search results by just four tenths of a second they could

00:46.060 --> 00:52.510
lose up to a million searches per day meaning they'd lose out on all that advertising money that they

00:52.510 --> 00:52.980
get.

00:54.410 --> 01:00.750
Now there are infinite ways to make your code more performant and your web site faster.

01:00.770 --> 01:06.860
So in this section we're going to focus on the main things that get you 80 percent of the benefits.

01:06.920 --> 01:08.320
Let's get started shall we.

01:09.070 --> 01:15.440
First let's recap what happens when you usually browse to a Web site.

01:15.520 --> 01:17.300
We have a client and a server.

01:17.350 --> 01:24.430
Let's say you're on Google over here and you want to visit super fresh dotcom this awesome Web site.

01:24.430 --> 01:29.000
Well in that case you make a request a request to the server.

01:29.430 --> 01:37.330
That server returns the ASTM file and then within the mail file the browser starts reading it and finds

01:37.350 --> 01:37.640
you.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.250
I have a style sheet that I need to get.

01:40.270 --> 01:48.300
So goes to the server once again grabs the stylesheet and then as it's looking at the file.

01:48.430 --> 01:50.860
We also have an image that we need.

01:50.920 --> 01:58.200
So in the background it requests the image and again the image gets transferred over and over.

01:58.210 --> 02:00.750
There's also a script tag a job a secure file.

02:00.750 --> 02:03.220
So again we need that as well.

02:05.190 --> 02:12.090
Now this is a simplified version of what happens and we'll get into the nitty gritty details who the

02:12.090 --> 02:14.230
performance sections of this course.

02:14.580 --> 02:17.280
But the core concepts are here.

02:17.280 --> 02:25.920
We have a client and a server relationship and the e-mail file gives us an indication of what files

02:26.160 --> 02:34.100
we need from the server OK but how can we think critically about performance and improve the process.

02:34.790 --> 02:38.390
Especially as our web applications get bigger and bigger.

02:38.420 --> 02:44.020
Most people are just happy putting a Web site online but that's not us right.

02:44.030 --> 02:49.820
We want to impress our bosses we want to show them that we just improve their company's Web site which

02:49.940 --> 02:52.200
translates to more revenue for them.

02:52.980 --> 03:01.080
We want to show Brunow that we know what we're doing and that we're pretty much a superstar so remember

03:02.280 --> 03:06.630
your visitors expect your site to load within two seconds.

03:07.460 --> 03:13.130
And about half of them will leave if it takes more than three seconds.

03:13.990 --> 03:19.510
Now each second of delay decreases customer satisfaction and possibly money.

03:19.510 --> 03:26.590
So nothing signals junior developer like having your portfolio website load an unnecessary five megabyte

03:26.620 --> 03:28.510
image for your home page.

03:29.180 --> 03:36.440
So in the next video and the ones following that we're going to learn these principles so that we never

03:36.440 --> 03:38.510
make performance mistakes again.

03:38.930 --> 03:40.260
I'll see that one by.
