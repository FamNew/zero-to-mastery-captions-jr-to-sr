In the last video we talked about minimizing text and minimizing images.

00:06.390 --> 00:10.730
And I said minimizing images is a little bit more complex.

00:10.770 --> 00:11.740
So let's take a look at that.

00:11.750 --> 00:12.420
And this video

00:16.360 --> 00:26.470
now the primary way to change an image size is to change the file format and pick the file format that

00:26.470 --> 00:28.290
is the best for the job.

00:28.600 --> 00:32.730
And this is actually fairly easy to do was just a few mouse clicks.

00:32.890 --> 00:41.510
We have jpeg gif P.N. G and SPG and these are the four main image file formats used on the web.

00:42.430 --> 00:45.530
And they each have their own specific use cases.

00:46.530 --> 00:54.540
So let's go through them and learn how to optimize them Jay Pags over here are usually used for photos

00:54.840 --> 01:00.150
images and things with many colors such as photographs.

01:00.180 --> 01:04.350
The one downside with JPEG is that they don't really allow for transparency.

01:04.470 --> 01:05.790
So what does that mean.

01:05.940 --> 01:13.020
Say for example you want an image background to be transparent so that the color of the background behind

01:13.020 --> 01:15.550
it shines through.

01:15.590 --> 01:20.770
Now with JPEG you can't really do that to have a transparent background.

01:20.770 --> 01:24.920
You must use something like PNB or gef which we'll talk about.

01:26.230 --> 01:31.260
So J bags for complex images with lots of colors.

01:31.410 --> 01:36.890
They also tend to be a little bit vague and file size I guess.

01:37.330 --> 01:44.800
Well everybody knows guess they often look grainy and oddly colored because usually limit the number

01:44.800 --> 01:47.260
of total colors that you can use in a GIF.

01:47.260 --> 01:56.870
It's usually somewhere between 2 to 256 and reducing the color count least to huge false savings.

01:57.090 --> 02:01.170
And that's why they're really really good for small animations.

02:01.170 --> 02:06.200
Everyone knows what a GIF is and there are more than enough cat gifs out there on the internet then

02:06.270 --> 02:14.520
to watch in the lifetime dingies usually limit the number of colors you can use and they tend to be

02:14.520 --> 02:20.310
a lot smaller in size than jetpacks because of that and they're used a lot around the web for things

02:20.310 --> 02:25.250
like Logos since they usually only have a few sets of colors that you need.

02:26.640 --> 02:31.640
The cool thing with piano is that you can add transparency to them which you cannot do in JPEG.

02:31.640 --> 02:41.630
As we said finally as Fiji is in a completely different category from all the other three file formats

02:41.630 --> 02:49.790
that we talked about there are actually something called vector graphics and these are files that designers

02:49.790 --> 02:56.870
usually work with on Adobe Illustrator or something like sketch where you can do with SVGA is that you

02:56.870 --> 03:06.140
can expand an SPG to several times its original size and it will be just a sharp and justice clear as

03:06.140 --> 03:08.170
the original was.

03:08.230 --> 03:14.980
Also they happen to be incredibly small for what they do and they're really really good for things like

03:15.400 --> 03:23.810
retina display or 40 displays and the cool part is you can also customize them using SS but they aren't

03:23.830 --> 03:25.090
just perfect.

03:25.090 --> 03:29.600
They usually tend to be very simplistic visual things with few callers.

03:30.770 --> 03:38.270
Now there are many more things we can go into with images and there are a ton of resources online to

03:38.690 --> 03:41.040
get familiar with each file type.

03:41.120 --> 03:46.310
For example there are new image formats that have come out recently with really cool sounding names

03:46.310 --> 03:51.300
like jpeg 2000 JPEG X are wepe.

03:51.470 --> 03:58.420
They are actually all superior compression and quality characteristics compared to these older JPEG-XR

03:58.610 --> 04:06.650
and PNB counterparts and encoding your images in this new file formats means they would load faster

04:06.650 --> 04:08.980
and consume less cellular data.

04:09.880 --> 04:14.890
However browsers support for these new types it's still not completely there yet.

04:14.890 --> 04:16.610
So we're just going to focus on these for now.

04:17.660 --> 04:22.760
Now the main thing you want to get out of this part is that you want to pick the right format of images

04:23.330 --> 04:27.830
and then compress them as much as you can without minimizing their quality.

04:28.830 --> 04:31.620
I'm going to show you some compression techniques in the next video.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.220
So don't worry.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.680
All right Ali some resources for you to check out.

04:35.690 --> 04:38.030
If you really want to learn more about these topics.

04:38.120 --> 04:42.070
But for now let's keep going into the next video.

04:42.260 --> 04:43.800
See that one by.
