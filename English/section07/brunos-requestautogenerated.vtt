Hey it's Bruno here again.

00:03.460 --> 00:11.010
Hey I've been really impressed with your work lately and I've also heard about this cool thing lately

00:11.010 --> 00:13.550
called typescript.

00:13.630 --> 00:20.320
Our team at Kaikohe Corp. is growing and I think now is a good time to add static type checking into

00:20.320 --> 00:22.960
our codebase to minimize bugs.

00:22.960 --> 00:23.940
What do you think.

00:23.950 --> 00:27.880
I trust you since you know you've done some really good work for us.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.950
I'd like to know your opinion on it.

00:29.980 --> 00:30.420
All right.

00:30.490 --> 00:30.950
Great.

00:30.970 --> 00:32.800
Look forward to seeing your work on it.

00:33.020 --> 00:35.650
Hey P.S. love your outfit today.

00:35.740 --> 00:37.680
You've got such great fashion sense.

00:39.620 --> 00:42.060
All right here's another task for us.

00:42.290 --> 00:44.000
It's like it just never ends.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.330
More and more tasks.

00:45.350 --> 00:46.510
But we like it.

00:46.550 --> 00:47.720
We get to learn right.

00:48.500 --> 00:56.130
In this section we're going to learn all about static typing and what typescript brings to javascript.

00:56.140 --> 00:57.590
I'll see you in the next one.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.200
Bye bye.
