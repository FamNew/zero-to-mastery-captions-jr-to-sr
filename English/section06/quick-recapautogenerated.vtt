00:01.140 --> 00:02.580
Welcome back.

00:02.580 --> 00:09.510
I wanted to take a second here before we keep going with testing our robo friends up to just go over

00:09.510 --> 00:13.250
what we've learned from our slides and how it all makes sense now.

00:14.140 --> 00:20.530
We learned that now we have just that we can install that provides for us a test framework something

00:20.530 --> 00:29.650
that we can run tests in and this just also comes with an assertion library where we can use xpect dot

00:30.100 --> 00:38.860
to be equal or to have or all these things that we can do that we saw in our cheat sheet to assert something

00:38.950 --> 00:41.640
to make sure that this equals this.

00:41.890 --> 00:49.030
And then we also saw that just comes with a test runner something that we're able to run the test in

00:49.180 --> 00:50.920
and he saw that in my terminal.

00:50.980 --> 00:58.110
I always have those tests running and checking I make sure that things are always passing.

00:58.120 --> 01:04.210
We also saw that we have mocking functions that we can use.

01:04.290 --> 01:12.630
We saw that in our example where we built our wars API where we got all those people that we could mock

01:12.930 --> 01:19.660
the fetch function and make sure that it was called again something that comes with just sign on is

01:19.660 --> 01:24.110
a popular one that it works very very similar that you're going to see as well.

01:24.130 --> 01:31.950
And then finally we saw that we can do code coverage by running NPM test dash dash dash dash coverage

01:32.470 --> 01:36.940
and it gives us a coverage of where we have tests and where we don't.

01:36.940 --> 01:38.730
So that we can improve our app.

01:38.980 --> 01:43.010
I told you this is going to make sense and we're not even done yet.

01:43.030 --> 01:53.440
We saw that we can test our app programmatically but if we need any time to use some API we have those

01:53.440 --> 01:59.920
three options we can use the actual Daun we can use something like puppeteer for a headless browser

02:00.190 --> 02:08.540
or something like jazz dom which if we're using the Mount rendering an enzyme we can set up as well.

02:08.540 --> 02:09.340
Again there.

02:09.400 --> 02:17.320
This set up is fairly simple and you can check it out on the enzyme documentation Oh yeah and we also

02:17.320 --> 02:18.480
learned that and react.

02:18.490 --> 02:23.280
We can use enzyme and snapshot testing to make our tests super super easy.

02:23.330 --> 02:30.390
Again another reason that I love using just especially with re-act projects that is a quick break back

02:30.390 --> 02:30.810
to coding.

02:30.810 --> 02:33.870
We go in the next video and that one probably.
