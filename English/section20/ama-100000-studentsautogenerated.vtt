WEBVTT

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.210
Hey there.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.770
That's my face Andre.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.500
I'm not usually sitting in front of a computer not in front of a camera which I'm not comfortable with

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:21.850
but this is the AM A video and I want to just absolutely thank all of you because we have officially

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.930
had 100000 unique students which is insane.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.670
Absolutely mind blowing.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.680
I did an M a video when we hit a thousand students and I thought that was just extraordinary.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.300
And to be at one hundred thousand now is absolutely incredible.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.360
I feel extremely lucky.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:47.110
I feel extremely blessed and not to get too sappy here but I'm very very thankful for you watching this

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.920
video right now because I don't really do any marketing and it's it's all grown out of word of mouth.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.940
So thank you for telling your friends your family your kids whatever it is.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.290
I am extremely thankful that I get to do what I do and it's all because of you.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.740
All right.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.020
So no more happiness.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.980
Let's get to it.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.280
I asked you on discord some questions that you might have for me.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.830
There were a lot of questions unfortunately I won't be able to answer all of them.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.480
I don't want to make this into a boring one hour video so I've picked the ones that I thought had a

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.130
lot of people interested in them and hopefully I can give you some some answers.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.010
Keep in mind that you should form your own opinions and decisions based on these.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.690
This is just one person's view my view.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.500
It doesn't mean that I'm 100 percent correct if I thought that then I would have a youtube channel but

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.480
take it with a grain of salt.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.550
These are just my opinions.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.170
I may be wrong.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.780
I may be right.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.170
It's just what has worked in my life doesn't necessarily mean that it will work for you or the answers

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.240
are right for you.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.660
All right.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.120
Let's see first one here.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.400
We have Nick Salar who asks What's the best way to get into machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.900
That's actually a question that kept coming up a lot of people are interested in machine learning data

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.270
science.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.880
Anything related to a.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.470
Because it is extremely popular and a hot topic right now.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.220
I actually have a course coming up on it that tries to tackle that question because machine learning

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.880
right now it's a bit of a buzzword where it solves all your business problems when in fact maybe it's

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.100
not necessarily so.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.360
And I think there's developer interest to learn about machine learning as well as business analysts

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:42.390
and business decision makers to use machine learning and data to improve their profits and their business.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.440
So I don't really give you an answer for that one but it's one of those topics that I think in order

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.190
to learn about it you should at least learn to code be become a web developer force or perhaps have

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.270
some understanding of business data.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.320
Data analysis before you get into it.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.880
All right.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.580
Next Next question is from Inc.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.530
Talk about your life as a developer from start until now to learn from you.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.850
Well I think some of you know from my previous M.A. May I did not come from a computer science background.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.810
I came from a business background.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.430
I did also a minor in psychology and learned to code in my 20s.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.160
I'm 33 now by the way.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.400
Hopefully I don't look 33 but that's that's my age.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.160
And yeah I would break down the developer lifecycle into three phases.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.130
So the first one is where you're just learning you're learning to code everything is completely new

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.760
you feel extremely overwhelmed overwhelmed you don't know what to learn what person to trust what mentor

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.520
to have what course to take.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.890
That's a really big challenge.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.050
And getting to the point of understanding and being able to build something from scratch yourself I

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.280
think that's the first phase.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.580
The second phase was when when I was employed for the first time and though the first couple of years

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:10.840
working as a developer where you feel the imposter syndrome right where you feel like you just don't

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.660
know enough or somehow they hired you by mistake and while everybody else around you is smarter than

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.160
you.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:25.030
That phase really goes by the one advice that I have for that phase is to honestly be comfortable with

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.360
being uncomfortable that is ask as many questions as you want.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.550
Don't feel like you're raising your hand and asking questions.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.380
It's going to make you feel it's going to make others look at you like you're dumb or not good enough.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.430
The more questions you ask the better you'll have the answers and you'll find that the successful people

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.950
through this phase are the people who ask a ton of questions when they don't understand something they

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.820
tried to learn and try to grab as much experience as possible from those around you.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.110
And then the third phase is when you start to become a little bit of a senior developer when you start

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.180
to get confident in your abilities you perhaps start to lead projects perhaps other junior developers

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.910
look up to you and ask you questions.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:15.050
One of the biggest things with that face of a developer is to not almost get a God complex where you

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.920
feel like your opinions are the right ones and everybody else is is absolutely wrong.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.580
I've seen way too many really good developers get overconfident in themselves and have really strong

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.070
opinions where they don't take anything else into consideration.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:37.580
I think through that phase if you're able to understand everything it has pros and cons everything depends

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.020
on the situation in that you're not allowing only use graph.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:48.230
Q Oh I only use TypeScript and dynamic languages are trash but when you avoid those strong opinions

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.000
to almost make yourself feel like you're smart you're doing something wrong there.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.670
You want to be open to ideas open to suggestions and not forget to keep drawing from that face because

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.310
as you start to get more and more recognition maybe feel more confident.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.450
It's very easy to think that you've reached the pinnacle and you need to stop learning.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:16.580
This whole industry is all about learning and constantly evolving and what you know two years from now

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.410
will probably different than what you know now.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.910
So those are the three phases kind of the ones that I went through.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.100
Obviously I'm teaching now but for me learning doesn't stop.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.640
I'm constantly learning.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:33.830
I'm constantly trying to improve myself both in teaching but also as a developer and I hope that that

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.520
is the case with you as well.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.900
All right next question next question is from G.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.220
How many countries have you visited during the last year.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.580
Any suggestions to travel while working remote.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.900
So for some of you that don't know I I was completely remote.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:56.690
I carry my recorder recording equipment online and I set up my studio wherever I am in the world.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:04.810
So my courses have been recorded and in Ecuador in Nicaragua Colombia in Greece and Romania.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:11.360
Pretty much anywhere that I'm traveling I bring my recording equipment set up my little studio and and

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.520
record.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:18.320
So last year I traveled to I would say about seven or eight countries where I lived and then in them

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:27.740
long term My favorite was I actually recorded the master the coding interview course in a little house

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:33.940
on the side of a volcano in Ecuador where the last house at the very top of the volcano.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:41.120
So we had to hike down and grab groceries every time we needed to eat or wanted to cook dinner and hike

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.920
back up with all our groceries.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.480
That was a lot of fun.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.510
Any advice for Ramona.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:51.710
Honestly it's it's one of those life that it sounds nice but it also requires a lot of dedication and

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:59.150
and commitment to to work instead of just not being committed to a schedule and making it really easy

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.900
to go off and pretend like you're busy without actually accomplishing anything.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.820
So you do need to have a bit of structure.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:13.700
But for those that are self-motivated and determined enough and can keep track of tasks and don't get

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.190
distracted often it's it's definitely a lot of fun.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:26.120
All right this next question I think I got asked maybe five times from people like DA John shoe PA scramble

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:31.370
lock all of them essentially said Why did you quit your full time job.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.810
How come you're not a developer anymore.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:39.080
Well let's say that I'm still a developer I do a bit of consulting work on the side.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:44.840
The reason that I quit my developer job was mainly because I wanted to I wanted to travel a little bit

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.930
and to take a break.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:52.100
I had spent a couple of years working for other people and working on projects that perhaps I didn't

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.400
care too much about.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.220
I was working for other people's passion projects or businesses.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:03.530
And after a while that that kind of gets old or at least it did for me where I found that I stopped

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:07.780
learning as much I was just repeating and doing the same thing over and over.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:12.320
So I decided to quit and kind of figure out what what I want to do next.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.050
And along the way I decided to record some videos.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:23.780
My first course to mastery to just keep myself busy and keep doing something and cut and help people

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:30.890
who were like me where they didn't have a CSI background and wanted to get into web development but

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.460
there wasn't a clear path for them to do so.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:42.020
So I recorded that course and it took off and all of a sudden this became my full time job and now I

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:47.900
would 100 percent still go back to being a full time developer but I'm having so much fun teaching.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:54.830
I still get to code every day I still get to learn every day and if anything I think this way I have

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:59.090
a bigger impact on on people's lives.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.820
Than I did it when I worked on a single project.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:07.410
So that's why I quit my job and in the end of the day it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.070
I have another question here which is what is my biggest regret.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:15.540
I feel like I'm in an interview right now so I'll give you my interview answer.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.170
In case you ever get asked this in an interview.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.590
So my biggest regret.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:26.640
Honestly it's there's nothing I I'm really really happy that I learned coding when I did in my 20s and

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.650
not when I was young because when I was young I was able to learn different skills I was able to learn

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:39.120
about business about pop about psychology about communicating with others and people and those skills

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:45.420
helped me get my first job as a developer although maybe I started to code when I was a lot later on

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.550
in life.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.790
It's not like I didn't do anything before my 20s.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:54.300
I was learning different skills and for those people that perhaps are thinking Am I too old to learn

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:59.250
to code or I'm in my thirties and there's people you know in their teens that are learning to code right

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.440
now there's no way that I'm going to be able to keep up.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.360
Keep in mind that most likely have skill sets that other people don't.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:12.180
And when it comes to regret honestly there's nothing as long as you're learning every single day and

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.650
learning something useful over the years that's going to compound.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:22.830
And honestly every single mistake every single decision that you make leads you to to where you are

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.510
now which a little it sounds a little hokey pokey but but it is true.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:34.830
Honestly the there are no regrets if you're learning your you're never gonna have regrets in life.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.230
All right.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:35.920
Yes.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:41.860
Has gone yes asked me what annoyed you the most about being a developer.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:50.100
I usually don't get annoyed I'm pretty easygoing but the one thing that I did notice was that trust

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:55.920
people get more and more experienced they tend to form really strong opinions and everybody wants to

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.770
feel like they're part of a group.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:03.750
And I think we see that a lot on Twitter and YouTube and all these people really strong opinions that

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:08.020
kind of gang up on other people that have different beliefs than them.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:13.170
I think it's very easy in the developer community to have something like that where you're thinking

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:20.190
my react team is better than your angular team or TypeScript and static typing is the way to go or rest

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:21.860
is dead and let's all use graph.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:28.890
Q Well I think when you have that type of mentality it's it's really really hard to actually have smart

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:36.180
discussions and and and decisions within a project it becomes really really easy for those who feel

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:43.800
superior to others and feel confident in their opinions to really impose their opinions on others especially

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:49.430
junior developers that you know are susceptible and have less experience.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:55.470
So they start to believe these senior developers that perhaps have really strong opinions and in turn

00:12:55.470 --> 00:13:01.230
that kind of creates this wave of more and more people that think it's a good idea to have strong opinions

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:07.350
and debate with others and argue with others and and telling people that their code sucks and their

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:10.280
code is the right way of doing it.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:19.410
I think that was a little bit annoying to deal with because because I think it influences junior developers

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:24.510
a lot and I don't think it's a good attitude to have when working with others.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:31.350
I think being a being somebody senior being a lead being a project lead it means you're a person that

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.800
doesn't put other people down but it lifts others.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:40.200
And that was a little bit annoying because I thought that I saw that that was a little bit prevalent

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:46.560
where everybody's trying to almost beat each other and be a better developer than deal with this person

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.690
and this person instead of all of you growing together and learning together because there's enough

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:52.980
to evolve for jobs for everybody.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.860
You don't need to beat out everybody to be the number one developer.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:03.630
So that mentality was was a little bit annoying to me but then again I worked in Tron on Silicon Valley

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:12.600
and I think those areas especially have have really really strong individualistic philosophies.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.380
All right.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:18.290
This is another question from D.H. from where and how did you learn and become a developer.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:24.210
So when I started to learn to be a developer I probably spent I would say 20 dollars.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:31.570
I think I bought a book on H2 AML and CSX and the rest was all online for free just using online resources.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:37.170
The only difference was that when I started to learn there were very few resources online I think I

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:45.420
used one blog post that that told me to use Photoshop and GIMP and some tools that actually didn't even

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:45.900
need.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:53.130
But it was really hard to find resources online when I started to learn so I essentially just try to

00:14:53.130 --> 00:15:00.180
grab as many resources as possible and create my own curriculum but it's not like it is now I think.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.310
Right now we have a lot of resources online.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:08.390
It's a lot easier and there's more of a clear cut path to become a web developer.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:14.070
So I'm a little bit jealous but I also did the same thing that you probably are doing which is watch

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:21.120
a lot of online courses read or a lot of books read a lot of articles and most importantly building

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:25.970
my own projects and coding as much as possible that nothing beats actually coding.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:31.050
Now you can watch videos all day but if you're not doing anything if you're not producing anything that's

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:31.650
not.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:37.070
It's like watching a tennis match and trying to become a better tennis player is just not going to happen.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.390
We have Jamie who asks What's the best way to practice code is it good for.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:48.150
Is it good by imitating someone else code for practicing again it goes back to my last point.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:53.860
The best way to practice code is to code the more you code the more you practice the better it is.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:59.330
But keep in mind that the best way to code is to solve your own problems create your own projects.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:05.880
I actually don't recommend just watching all my videos and following along without coding because then

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.450
you're not going to be able to do things on your own.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:16.130
The best way to code is to code by by doing your own thing.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:19.580
You can watch a hundred videos on people coding and follow along.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:25.680
But if you don't understand why we're doing things then when you're left to your own device you're not

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.380
going to be able to do anything.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.590
So the best way to code is think of a project today.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:37.770
Think of a task that you have to do over and over in your life and see if I can automate it with code.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.150
That's the best way to learn tai Lim.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:43.810
I would ask What is your favorite tech stack.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:49.260
My favorite test that tech stack is the one that lets me accomplish my goal as fast as possible.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.390
That's a very vague answer.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:59.010
But honestly anything that lets me finish fast and deliver something fast is my favorite tech stack

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:04.650
because I tend to work by myself or in small teams.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.960
I really prefer things that are efficient.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:13.230
So for example I'm not a big fan of typescript because although you get type safety and static typing

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.000
it's a lot of extra code.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.280
It's the same reason that I personally am not a big fan of Java programming not because it's not a great

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:27.420
language but because for my personally use cases I'm now working at a big company with thousands of

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.390
developers for let's say financial institution.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:37.440
If I'm building a personal project I rather use something quick and easy like Python or JavaScript to

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.370
write a few lines of code and accomplish a goal.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:46.200
So there's really no favorite text that gets the stack that allows me to accomplish a goal the fastest

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:52.950
which happens to be usually dynamically typed languages and usually the languages that I'm comfortable

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:57.630
with I don't need to learn something new until I have a need to to learn something new.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:58.690
All right.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.540
Mora Les's junior Tess Morales Junior.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.870
That's what it is.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:07.310
Any advice on escaping the golden handcuffs and going freelance.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:13.170
I have a cushy non developer job at Google and it's hard to imagine leaving one family in a mortgage.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:20.850
But I long for freedom and this this topic of freelancer is another topic that has come up many many

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:25.910
times so let me address it right now.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:33.260
You know I get to work remotely I get to work for myself which I feel very fortunate fortunate about

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.780
and I'm extremely lucky.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:41.280
But when it comes to freelancing I actually am against freelancing.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.370
Obviously every situation is different.

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:43.910
Different.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:49.310
But let me explain why I think freelancing might not be the best option for most of you not all of you

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:55.590
but for most of you you see when it comes to freelancing let's say you're just starting to learn.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:56.900
You're just learning to code.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:02.600
If you go straight into freelancing you lose the ability to work with others to learn from others and

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.970
actually be in a company and understand how their processes work how they work with developers.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:14.030
You gain a lot of experience by working on projects with others with other developers working with management

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:19.180
teams working with with project managers scrum masters.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:24.760
That's a really really valuable experience that I really recommend for people just getting into coding.

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:29.090
Now let's say that you've had a couple of years of experience you've worked with teams you have that

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.060
experience should you go into freelancing.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:38.730
I think you should go into freelancing if you have a clear edge or a clear advantage over others.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:45.020
For example you have an existing client base and you have people that really trust your work or you

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.740
offer a really unique skill.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:54.860
The problem with freelancing right now is that you're essentially battling with thousands potentially

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.540
millions of other freelancers to get a job.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:04.790
A lot of people might go to places like work or any type of place where you can bid on projects.

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:14.020
What happens is in those scenarios people just bid and it's a battle to lower and lower prices.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:21.440
So what happens you eventually become an employee of a contract that you probably didn't charge enough

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.130
for.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:28.550
So it's really hard for you to compete with people that keep lowering and lowering and lowering prices

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:33.650
and you'll see that if you're a freelancer that's what will happen unless you have an established client

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:41.060
base unless you have a really distinct advantage maybe you're extremely skilled in graphic design and

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:46.880
you're well known then yes maybe you can charge more for it but people that are usually looking for

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.540
freelancers are usually looking for the cheapest price.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:57.920
And when you do that you stop valuing your time you stop being a slave to the person that created the

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.420
contract and you're trying to fulfill somebodies you're trying to fulfill.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:08.420
And please this person so that they give you a good review for the next contract job.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:16.370
I think freelancer jobs are can be good but there's also a lot of issues that come with it.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:23.720
If you want to be a freelancer or perhaps be your own boss I think there's better ways for you to go

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.170
about it.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:30.800
I think there's smarter ways to go about it instead of competing with others on price.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.140
So I know that's not really helpful is just my personal opinion when it comes to freelancing.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:41.690
But it is a question that I get past a lot freelancing essentially involves you taking a lot of time

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:47.780
finding clients working a lot for clients and at the end of the day why not just work for a company

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:51.110
that already has the clients for you so you can gain that experience.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:59.360
You might think you have the freedom of being a freelancer being your own job but instead your you are

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.120
an employee of whoever your contractor is.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:02.870
That's my advice.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:06.580
I know it's not it's not very very helpful.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:13.340
But like I said it's not for everybody I think there's there's better opportunities for you to work

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:14.360
remotely.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.830
You can work for remote companies.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:20.930
There's tons of Web sites right now of showing companies that hire remote workers.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:26.540
I think that's a better option for you than being a freelancer because the reasons that I mentioned

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:28.290
previously.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:31.120
JT álvarez eight task.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:36.350
How is life as far as time spent with family and doing what you like now as an instructor and before

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.260
when you work for a company to enjoy.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:43.370
Do you enjoy work more now or before when you work for a company hands down.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.900
I absolutely love what I'm doing now.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.500
I wake up every day and all I can think about is is work and what I'm going to teach or what video I'm

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:58.730
going to record or what coding challenge I'm going to do I am I feel so extremely lucky to be at a point

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:02.240
in my life where I absolutely adore and love what I'm doing.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:08.600
And I wouldn't I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world being a developer was absolutely great

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.350
working full time for a company.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.000
I loved it.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:18.630
You know I had a lot of friends I got along really well with with my bosses with my clients.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:25.480
But having having the freedom to to work on what I want to work on my projects.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:32.610
But most importantly knowing that the work that I do maybe impacts just a little bit a little bit of

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.730
the world.

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:40.500
I think it is a really rewarding feeling and I'm extremely thankful to to know that you know not everybody

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:47.020
is going to love my courses but at least there are some that do enjoy my courses and gain a bit of help

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:53.320
in their career through it and that is the most rewarding feeling and honestly the past two years since

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.440
I've started to teach.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:24:01.420
Have been some of the happiest moments of my life and I know this thing isn't going to last forever.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:07.210
I know I'm not going to teach forever but I'm really appreciative of this moment to have this opportunity.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:08.030
At least for now.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:08.370
All right.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:16.000
Mr. Lucifer's asks be safe secure and stable life being a skillful employee working for someone else

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:20.830
or dreaming big and starting a business on your own and being your own boss.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.220
What path you suggest.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:24.460
Honestly it really depends.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:30.280
I think everybody wants the ideal work for yourself own your own business work remotely.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.410
Live wherever you want.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:39.220
It sounds sexy but it's it's not for everybody and you know I before I started teaching before I was

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.550
a developer I started a bunch of businesses.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:47.680
I was running a surfing yoga retreats in Nicaragua I was doing Adventure Tours.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.200
I was doing adventurous businesses.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:56.170
I was trying all these different things that in the end weren't extremely successful but there are a

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:57.010
lot of fun.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:00.620
And meanwhile I had friends who were doing their MBA.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.970
They were becoming lawyers and you know they have really nice life right now.

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:13.960
They have they have families who are very comfortable and there's actually there's actually an advantage

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.550
there.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:19.810
As you start to work at a company and you see people leave that company most people think oh why should

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:20.750
I should leave too.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.020
But you can also look at it as an opportunity for somebody else has left.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:32.800
Now you are one step closer to going up that that corporate or company ladder.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.180
So I think it's not it's not one is better than the other.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:42.700
It really depends on why you prefer what kind of lifestyle you prefer you do you want more of a stable

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:48.400
comfortable life to make sure that you can provide for your family or are you at a stage in your life

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:54.340
where you can perhaps take more risks and you're okay with the higher ups in high high Downs high ups

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.260
and high downs that may pay off.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:03.130
Maybe not in the end but I think every day if you're working towards what your ideal life should look

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:07.090
like eventually you will get there but don't expect to get there overnight.

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:08.740
You know it's it's hard work.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:09.610
Nothing comes easy.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.260
There's no easy solution.

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:17.500
So all you can do is kind of work towards that goal and learn every day and improve every day and eventually

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.490
you'll get there but it really matters.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.680
It's the best thing you can do is to have a plan for yourself tonight.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:29.050
Write down what you value and based on those values and what makes you happy.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.800
Decide what type of path you want to take.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.540
I got all philosophical there for you.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.530
All right let's get back to some coding.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.280
Justin W. Lin.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:42.060
Hey Justin asks How do you decide to learn next.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:48.130
In this ever changing glass landscape from redux graphics you all react angular view SSR.

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:52.510
There's so much to learn so little time so I guess how do you decide what to learn then and how you

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:54.040
actually learn and make time for it.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:59.100
I think this is actually something I I'm pretty good at.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:05.470
I think I'm good at and that is because when I started to learn how to code I realized how much is out

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:06.190
there.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:10.810
I've become become really good at selecting only the right things to learn.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:17.080
Then there's the famous parade principle which says the 20 percent usually accounts for 80 percent of

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:17.450
value.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:25.000
So what's the 20 percent that's going to give you 80 percent of a value when learning and you know things

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.800
like graphic you all for example.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.120
They're extremely popular.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:33.760
So a lot of people want to learn it but at the end of the day how can you how many people actually use

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.530
craft while in production how many people have actually built something with craft you all that creates

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.120
value.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:47.080
I like to look at technologies and see see what's what's hot and what's trending but that's not necessarily

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:51.990
jump really deep into them until there's a clear need for me to learn it.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.330
So for example V-J.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:54.180
Yes.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:59.410
Yeah I know a bit of view yes but I wouldn't call myself an expert because I haven't had to use the

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:03.330
view I can use react or I can use angular.

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:09.460
So being selective in why you learn instead of trying to learn everything is going to be a better long

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:18.580
term strategy over the course of your career because learning never stops and the more you learn the

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:24.450
more you start to realize that it's not about the syntax is not about learning the libraries.

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:28.090
It's not about reading the documentation from start to finish.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:33.240
It's about to understanding the higher principles the why was this tool built.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.040
Why are we doing things the way it is.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.500
What problem is it solving.

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:43.380
Being able to understand those and discuss those is going to be really really important because at the

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:47.910
end of the day the fundamentals is is what matters not the syntax.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:53.970
If you learn the fundamentals if you learn to think like a developer think about systems and how things

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:54.870
communicate.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:59.660
That's a lot more valuable than learning the newest react hoax API.

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:08.400
I mean that could still be important but but as you can see I am very selective in what I learn and

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:12.630
I'm not I'm not trying to learn 10 languages at the same time.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:17.220
If I want to learn something I'll dedicate maybe a year to get really really good at something and then

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:18.720
move on to the next thing.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:26.190
So really being picky as if you're dating a new technology and making sure that it's the right one is

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.910
the way to go.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:32.100
Oh and with that said you obviously have to enjoy what you're doing.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:36.810
If you don't enjoy learning then that's gonna be really hard so that's just something that has to come

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:43.500
for yourself and being able to enjoy the learning process because that's that's going to be your biggest

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:43.850
asset.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.570
If you enjoy learning you're going to learn more.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:50.400
Adrian asks How long do you plan on continue doing courses

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.400
because well this isn't going to last forever right.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.730
Honestly I I'm not sure I'm it's been close to two years now that I've been doing this.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.890
I don't imagine doing this for for a lifetime.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.190
There's only so much I could teach.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.860
I'm going to keep going until I I stop enjoying it.

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:11.600
Right now I really enjoy the process.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:18.350
I get a lot of reward by by hearing your your reviews and how pleased you are with the courses.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.830
So that really drives me to create more but eventually I will have to stop.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:27.270
I can't just keep creating courses they do take a lot of time and effort.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:36.480
So I hope that I can keep going for for a few more years but one day maybe you retire and and spend

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.300
a little more time with family or move on to something else.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.480
But for now don't worry I'm not going anywhere.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.630
Balloon asks Do you play any instruments.

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:51.510
No I am the least musically talented artistically talented person you'll ever beat.

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:56.800
I took piano lessons guitar lessons when I was a kid and I'm I'm hopeless.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:03.240
Thank God coding exists and thank God sports exists because if if I had to do anything in the arts I

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.130
would be I would not be very good.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:10.500
Garrison asks be really inspirational for all of us.

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:15.600
Do you want to do with the next 10 years of your life coaching business.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:21.180
Looks like he is the same age as me so just asking what's what's the next 10 years of my life look like

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:24.450
the next 10 years of my life is going to evolve.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.910
Learning every day I want to.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:31.470
Whether it's coding whether it's different things have different hobbies that I want to keep improving

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:32.670
at.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:38.070
I really like surfing so I want to become a better surfer and there's so many things that I really want

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.450
to improve.

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:44.490
So honestly every single day my goal is to learn I want to hopefully have a family by then and have

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:54.540
a house and and just enjoy life and hopefully in 10 years I'm retards being able to being able to spend

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:58.710
every single day with my son or daughter and just enjoying life.

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:04.140
But honestly that what I'm doing now is not much different than what I hoped to be doing ten years from

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:11.370
now because I am really really happy with with how life is right now and I wouldn't really change anything.

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:16.860
Dorian again asks Do you think all the races you do in yoga and exercises help you mental clarity and

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:21.290
have helped your career as a developer when things get rough.

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:28.380
Yes so fun fact I'm I'm also a yoga instructor on the side and I do I do a lot of adventure racing as

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:35.460
well and both of those things I think actually really help with being a developer and dealing with different

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.570
situations at work.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:42.810
I think for adventure racing it it puts you into situations that are extremely uncomfortable that you

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:49.950
have to just survive through and then with yoga obviously it steals your mind especially with meditation

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:51.150
as well.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:55.830
I think those are extremely important especially when compared to coding when you're staring at the

00:32:55.830 --> 00:33:02.170
screen and everything is usually fast paced and it's really really easy to get lost in your head.

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:08.250
I think balancing out coding with something that's complete opposite like yoga or meditation again not

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:11.330
to get a little hippy here.

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:20.700
But you know I think doing different things is as important in being physically active being mentally

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:26.230
strong is this is your vessel and this is your body and you should take care of it and it will only

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:32.440
improve you as a developer and as a coder so I 100 percent think that you know although for some people

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.000
it may be silly to meditate.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:39.270
Although for some people they don't actually enjoy exercising everybody has their different things.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:45.040
But I think doing something other than coding is really really important for that balance and to not

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:51.790
burn yourself burn yourself out of sin and ask about interview and the fact that he's really worried

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:58.900
about interviews and that he doesn't know enough and honestly just keep this might because because this

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:02.020
is something I hear from so many people.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:06.900
Everybody is just a child trapped in an adult's body.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:13.300
No human knows everything perfectly and most likely the person sitting across from you that's asking

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:21.880
you question on a on an interview doesn't know everything has their own insecurities has their own areas

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:28.540
that they're not an expert in so go into an interview knowing that this person is not God it's not the

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:31.620
ultimate smartest person that you'll ever meet.

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.560
They have their flaws and their issues.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:40.120
And if you start to realize that there's no such thing as a perfect developer of perfect coding everybody

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.500
is just trying to pretend like they're smart.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.570
Everybody's just trying to pretend like they're old.

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:49.580
Remember everybody just a kid inside trapped inside an adult's body.

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:56.530
You start to realize that this whole world that we live in this whole system that we're in is just a

00:34:56.530 --> 00:35:01.870
game just like your coder just like you're a programmer and you're trying to create a system.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:10.430
This is simply a system that you need to learn to adapt to and to try to essentially beat or improve.

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:13.200
So put yourself in their situation.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:15.010
They want to feel important.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:17.680
They want to feel like they're doing a good job.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:23.740
So maybe asking them questions during the interview maybe praising them for something that they did

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.360
even though they're the ones being interviewed is going to make them feel better.

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:32.270
That perhaps will make them ask you better or easier questions again.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.000
Think of it as a system.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:41.400
Think of it as a game and realize that there is nothing and nothing is extremely serious and important.

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:44.800
Everything is just a game they can play and that he can improve.

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:51.360
And if you start looking at life hood interviews as a as a game I think it becomes a lot more fun.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.640
And it also removed some of those insecurities.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:58.750
I don't know if that answer helped but kind of went on a tangent there but hopefully that that helps

00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:59.290
a little bit.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.150
All right.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:03.070
Last question because this video is getting a little too long.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:08.580
So Charles mentioned asks What's the difficult day for you at the moment.

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:16.400
Your courses are very very kind of you seem to be your healthy way of living in your sporty attitude.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:22.930
It almost be worth a course on how to balance your life and the way you do things while you code.

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:30.010
I guess I kind of already talked about this but my my everyday life usually involves in the morning

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:37.150
drinking coffee reading articles and catching up in the industry learning a little bit.

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:44.770
I really like mourning for learning and then I usually either record or plan recording or edit videos

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.080
in the afternoon.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:52.360
Then around 1 2 o'clock I usually go out for a run do some exercises try to get outside not stare at

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:56.170
the screen and then be active and then I come back.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:04.210
I usually check out my emails answer questions go on discord and chat with other students and then usually

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:05.620
by 5 o'clock I'm done.

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:09.910
I don't do any work I stop whatever I'm doing because I know after 5 o'clock.

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:18.070
For me personally I'm not productive so I usually spend time with family with my girlfriend or do social

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:25.330
activities or maybe go play some tennis go play some soccer go for a hike just to relax and I usually

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.690
go to bed at 10 o'clock not that very exciting.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:31.040
I don't I don't enjoy going to bars or clubs anymore.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:36.140
I'm I'm an old soul and at 10:00 I'm I'm ready for bed and I'm ready for the next day.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.750
So a pretty pretty boring day.

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:45.380
Nothing too exciting but it's it's it's what I like right how do.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.190
This.

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:49.720
This was the a video again I want to thank you.

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:56.940
I cannot believe that there's a hundred thousand students that are taking my courses and honestly if

00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:01.210
it was just me I would never get to one hundred thousand students.

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:07.870
Every single one of you that talk to others recommend my courses that really help me get to where I

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:16.060
am and I cannot express how thankful I am for for everything that that you have done that you have shown

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.200
support for and I am.

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:23.590
I hope to continue to keep impressing you and keep help you with with your learning journey.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:29.680
And yeah I'm I'm really really thankful so thank you.
