00:06.110 --> 00:13.400
And you can already start to see some things that we can clean up here we can just copy and paste this

00:13.400 --> 00:24.540
list just create one more instance and says filter's robot correctly to say that the will say three

00:24.540 --> 00:26.700
for an hour just to keep this clean.

00:27.900 --> 00:40.780
Will say that the Konst filter or filtered robots should equal an empty array.

00:40.840 --> 00:48.640
And this time we're searching for the letter J which doesn't exist in name and we expect the filtered

00:49.540 --> 00:56.790
robots to be called the dummy filtered robots that we gave at

01:00.140 --> 01:03.530
let's say of.

01:03.740 --> 01:05.420
And we see that something is failing

01:08.380 --> 01:11.280
because Mach 2 is not defined.

01:11.290 --> 01:14.700
We need to give it three.

01:14.820 --> 01:16.970
And there you have it.

01:17.010 --> 01:24.420
We've now tested our main page at least the main page method of filtered robots

01:27.250 --> 01:33.330
and we also have some snapshot testing as well so let's just look at our code coverage for now let's

01:33.340 --> 01:36.530
just around NPM run tests.

01:36.610 --> 01:39.660
Dash dash dash dash coverage

01:44.280 --> 01:48.860
and again this is always with testing there's always many more things they can do.

01:48.870 --> 01:56.870
We see that main main page has a hundred percent but there is a branch percentage.

01:56.880 --> 02:03.430
We're only testing 50 percent of the branch and you see that the uncovered line is on 28.

02:03.540 --> 02:14.230
If we go back we can go to main page and see that we have is pending on line 28.

02:14.230 --> 02:16.030
How cool is that the test says.

02:16.030 --> 02:16.480
All right.

02:16.600 --> 02:25.840
We're testing that the card list is rendering because we're always testing with is pending is true.

02:26.860 --> 02:33.810
As you can see here in our in our mock props we always have is pending to false.

02:33.850 --> 02:37.350
So we might want to test is pending to true as well.

02:37.510 --> 02:43.780
And I'm going to leave that up to you to add the important concept here is that there are so many ways

02:43.780 --> 02:45.230
to test.

02:45.280 --> 02:51.220
You can always use the coverage you report as a reference but try to be smart about your tests and make

02:51.220 --> 02:57.940
sure that you spend your time wisely because you're just going to have finished things that you can

02:57.940 --> 02:58.440
do.

02:58.450 --> 03:00.690
But you only have limited time.

03:02.020 --> 03:03.090
That's it for now.

03:03.250 --> 03:09.850
I hope you have a better understanding of how container and components testing can be enhanced with

03:10.180 --> 03:17.590
enzyme and snapshot testing and obviously the tools that come with just the rest of the test is something

03:17.650 --> 03:21.030
I'm leaving up to you to complete for components and containers.

03:21.040 --> 03:26.100
But let's get to actions Constance and reducers.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.110
We're going to want to test those as well.

03:29.110 --> 03:33.760
So the next video we're going to do just that I'll see in that one by.
