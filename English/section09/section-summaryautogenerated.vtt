Hey it's Bruno here.

00:04.210 --> 00:07.890
Look at this I really like this security guideline you've created.

00:08.050 --> 00:13.120
I think the CEO is going to absolutely love this and he's going to feel confident moving forward that

00:13.330 --> 00:17.660
we have implemented best practices for securing our apps.

00:17.830 --> 00:19.210
Really awesome job.

00:19.540 --> 00:22.910
I think you're starting to become a bit of a senior developer aren't you.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.540
Maybe you need a promotion soon.

00:25.490 --> 00:26.480
All right.

00:26.480 --> 00:27.270
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:27.270 --> 00:28.550
Go take a nice rest.

00:28.550 --> 00:29.520
You've worked hard today.

00:31.050 --> 00:33.950
Well I hope you had fun in this section.

00:33.950 --> 00:42.650
This is one of my favorite topics because it's just so interesting how many places that we have to be

00:42.650 --> 00:47.390
careful when building applications and it's often overlooked.

00:47.780 --> 00:53.480
We don't really talk too much about it but these are really really important to avoid not only causing

00:53.480 --> 00:56.600
companies damage but also users.

00:56.600 --> 01:03.350
We talked about injections and how they're the most common way that attackers hack web sites.

01:03.380 --> 01:07.490
We learned about third parties and how we want to make sure that they're trustworthy and up to date

01:07.880 --> 01:10.670
logging for information about our system.

01:10.700 --> 01:14.130
We pretty much learned that HEG B-S should be everywhere.

01:14.150 --> 01:21.500
We learned some interesting ways that hackers use cross-site scripting and see surf to do bad things.

01:21.560 --> 01:25.820
We learned about having secure headers for our requests.

01:26.000 --> 01:33.860
We learned about the rule of least priviledge that is to give the literalist access possible to members

01:34.760 --> 01:39.260
about password storage and how we should store hashed passwords.

01:39.980 --> 01:44.530
We learned that we pretty much can't trust anyone because Darth Vader is everywhere.

01:44.810 --> 01:51.890
And then finally we touched lightly on the authentication topic but we understood that password management

01:51.920 --> 01:58.760
and authenticating user is a very critical part of our app that we're going to go further into in the

01:58.760 --> 02:02.900
JWT and sessions section.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.980
But we should have these rules in the back of our head every time we build apps.

02:07.020 --> 02:14.160
And as long as we follow these rules we've covered majority of the topics that really really could affect

02:14.460 --> 02:15.660
products and companies.

02:15.660 --> 02:17.040
Are there more than this.

02:17.040 --> 02:17.980
Absolutely.

02:18.150 --> 02:24.750
But as I said you're never going to have 100 percent security what you can do though is be smart about

02:24.750 --> 02:32.160
it and try to tackle the big ticket items that are easy to implement obvious and will make your application

02:32.160 --> 02:34.290
more secure than the average

02:37.300 --> 02:44.790
by the way the wasp or the Open Web Application Security Project releases every year.

02:45.660 --> 02:51.780
The top 10 biggest issues on the web when it comes to security and they have a really really good information

02:51.960 --> 02:55.080
on how to prevent them why you can do.

02:55.170 --> 02:57.210
And every year things change.

02:57.210 --> 03:03.790
So this is a great place to stay up to date with the latest security features are highly recommended.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.420
They're really really good especially the Avast top 10.

03:07.440 --> 03:13.950
Like I said it's a great read that you can see for yourself what bad people do.

03:13.950 --> 03:18.550
But for now I think we deserve some rest.

03:18.560 --> 03:21.750
Go dig a break and I'll see you in the next section.

03:21.990 --> 03:22.190
Buh-Bye.
