00:01.300 --> 00:04.870
Good morning this is you.

00:05.170 --> 00:07.270
You're starting a new job today.

00:07.450 --> 00:09.960
You're excited but nervous.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.390
This is a big shot company in Silicon Valley.

00:13.480 --> 00:16.450
Its name is Kaiko Corp.

00:16.540 --> 00:24.690
It's the biggest company that everyone is talking about and it has two big
products that has made it famous.

00:24.890 --> 00:27.450
One is a robo friends app.

00:27.680 --> 00:33.020
Everyone is collecting these robots and it's hotter than Pokemon Go.

00:33.020 --> 00:39.440
The other is a face detection smart brain up that is going to revolutionize the whole industry.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.530
This is a big opportunity for you.

00:42.620 --> 00:43.570
Let's get to work.

00:44.530 --> 00:45.920
You get into work.

00:45.970 --> 00:48.220
You meet the team and the boss.

00:48.250 --> 00:51.000
His name is Bruno by the way.

00:51.130 --> 00:53.830
He always has perfect hair.

00:53.890 --> 00:55.950
I don't know how he does it.

00:56.010 --> 01:01.930
Anyway after a few minutes he pulls you to the side and tells you their senior developer just left

01:01.930 --> 01:03.110
the company today.

01:03.980 --> 01:07.260
I hope he can fill the big void that she's leaving behind.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.400
No pressure Bruno says.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.090
But wait.

01:11.090 --> 01:12.420
You're terrified.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.550
You're not a senior developer.

01:14.630 --> 01:16.580
Anxiety rushes over you.

01:16.580 --> 01:22.850
He wants a lot of things done. A little bit later you find out that the senior developer just left to

01:22.850 --> 01:24.740
go work for Google.

01:24.740 --> 01:25.700
Great.

01:25.700 --> 01:27.690
Those two are going to be some big shoes to fill.

01:28.770 --> 01:36.390
But back to Bruno. Bruno says there's quite a few things he would like to do with the company and he

01:36.390 --> 01:37.710
wants your help.

01:37.710 --> 01:41.160
And as a matter of fact you look confident and smart.

01:41.400 --> 01:45.420
And he wants you to take the lead on their projects.

01:45.420 --> 01:51.300
There's a pile of tasks that he would like to complete to really make Kaiko Corp. the best software

01:51.300 --> 01:53.880
development company.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.820
So let the adventure begin.

01:57.540 --> 01:58.090
OK.

01:58.350 --> 01:59.700
Back to Me.

01:59.700 --> 02:00.170
Sure.

02:00.180 --> 02:06.420
This story may seem silly but this course is designed to mimic real life scenarios.

02:06.540 --> 02:12.480
In each section you're going to learn something new that is considered a hard topic for a junior developer

02:13.200 --> 02:15.320
but you're going to master it.

02:15.570 --> 02:21.960
Then we're going to implement whatever we've learned for Keiko Corp's projects so that you can be a

02:21.960 --> 02:23.350
superstar developer.

02:23.370 --> 02:25.110
You've always wanted.

02:25.320 --> 02:31.800
This course is designed to have everything flow together and each topic build on top of one another

02:32.070 --> 02:33.360
like Lego blocks.

02:34.210 --> 02:38.060
To get the full experience go through each video in order.

02:38.200 --> 02:43.900
And once you are done the course, you can use the videos as reference to each section you want to go

02:43.900 --> 02:45.680
back to.

02:45.860 --> 02:50.740
By the way creating a course that is suitable for everybody is difficult.

02:50.750 --> 02:57.640
The course starts off fairly easily but we'll get into harder and harder topics as we progress.

02:57.650 --> 03:05.320
What I can promise you is this that each topic is relevant to no matter what level of your experience.

03:05.510 --> 03:07.270
So stick with it.

03:08.290 --> 03:10.240
And good luck in your journey.
