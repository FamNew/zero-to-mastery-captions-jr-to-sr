00:01.820 --> 00:02.540
Welcome back.

00:02.600 --> 00:11.700
We have two topics to cover and the next one sounds a little bit like I'm paranoid don't trust anyone.

00:12.020 --> 00:20.150
And if we go to the next slide it's completely empty because this image requires the full screen.

00:20.190 --> 00:28.060
All right what is happening here now throughout all the security videos you might have realized something

00:28.630 --> 00:30.620
we just can't trust anything.

00:30.640 --> 00:35.410
We can't assume that there's good people everywhere and that everything's in a work out as expected

00:35.650 --> 00:46.840
with our CO so anywhere there is a connection with an outside system or an outside user user input.

00:46.910 --> 00:57.040
You are Relpax put post parameters cookies headers file uploads e-mails form fields tons and tons of

00:57.040 --> 01:00.820
things inputs come from many many places.

01:01.630 --> 01:07.830
And we have to assume that not everybody is going to answer what they're supposed to enter.

01:08.080 --> 01:15.070
So in any process that we have where there's a connection between systems we have to assume that there's

01:15.100 --> 01:19.710
Darth Vader over here just watching you trying to be really really bad.

01:20.080 --> 01:25.500
So you have to make sure that wall when you build software you don't trust anybody.

01:25.660 --> 01:30.700
And I know it sounds paranoid but the idea is to write good code and be smart about why you are allowed

01:30.700 --> 01:31.330
to do.

01:31.600 --> 01:32.830
Here's an example.

01:32.830 --> 01:38.390
Server maybe I've allowed my server to have requests from this domain.

01:38.410 --> 01:47.480
I've set my headers using helmet amusing as I'm pretty sure we're good well if somehow.

01:47.790 --> 01:54.240
Darth Vader over here gets access to the client and the domain name.

01:54.630 --> 02:01.560
He can perhaps just bombard your server with requests after requests after requests to requests until

02:01.560 --> 02:08.220
a Crash's your server and then oh yeah you just lost a ton of money because your server now can't run

02:08.220 --> 02:09.680
that shopping cart anymore.

02:10.510 --> 02:17.630
And then again you have to realize oh yeah maybe I should add a rate limiter like the rate limit package

02:17.720 --> 02:23.240
from NPM that allows us to make sure that we can just keep requesting requesting requesting requesting

02:23.510 --> 02:24.730
to the server.

02:25.010 --> 02:28.910
And there are so many cases that you just can't keep track of.

02:28.970 --> 02:32.650
The best thing you can do is just keep that in mind as you write your software.

02:32.710 --> 02:38.740
Anytime you're making a connection to the outside world or accepting Iput from the outside world.

02:38.810 --> 02:43.780
Think about it how can you prevent bad actors from doing bad things.

02:45.490 --> 02:48.760
How can we protect the baby from Darth Vader.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.090
Hunchy the next one.

02:51.320 --> 02:51.590
Babai.
