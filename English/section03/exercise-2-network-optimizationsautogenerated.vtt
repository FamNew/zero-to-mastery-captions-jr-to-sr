Welcome back back to our super cool awesome Web site with this little little cute puppy.

00:07.090 --> 00:12.660
Anyway I have a fun little exercise to make sure that we got the points that we covered in this section.

00:12.820 --> 00:18.820
If this isn't your first rodeo as a web developer you might be thinking this is super easy Andre.

00:18.820 --> 00:21.280
Can we get some advanced stuff.

00:21.280 --> 00:27.490
And don't worry we still have lots and lots to cover but we really want to solidify these fundamentals

00:27.580 --> 00:33.460
that we're learning because I want to realize that each video on this course is a little Lego block

00:33.520 --> 00:40.930
that we build on top of each time each time getting a little bit more complex a little bit more advanced.

00:40.930 --> 00:42.450
So hang in there.

00:42.460 --> 00:46.870
Trust me things are going to get more and more interesting more and more advanced.

00:46.890 --> 00:51.400
And by the end of the course everything's going to be tied together and it's all going to make sense.

00:51.400 --> 00:56.190
So just hang in there but for now let's start off with a fun little exercise.

00:56.650 --> 01:05.140
We have this little web site over here and I'll provide for you the files for this Web site and using

01:05.380 --> 01:07.370
our new found knowledge in performance.

01:07.390 --> 01:16.540
I wanted to do four things on try to minimize all text minimize some of the images which are absolutely

01:16.810 --> 01:21.550
massive and you might want to add media queries.

01:21.550 --> 01:25.880
Perhaps we don't need to download these images every single time.

01:27.150 --> 01:31.400
And finally we also want to minimize the number of files.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.280
So how can we do that.

01:34.570 --> 01:41.710
I want you to also test it out as a real developer does in the chrome developer tools or whichever developer

01:41.710 --> 01:44.450
tool your browser has my case.

01:44.490 --> 01:51.940
I enjoy using Chrome so I'm going to open up the developer tools and end here in my web site.

01:51.980 --> 01:58.550
I wanted to check out the network tap and this network tab has a little bit or few options that we can

01:58.550 --> 02:07.860
use but just in case you're new to this if I refresh here you'll actually show me what's being downloaded.

02:07.890 --> 02:12.140
We see that we have a document so that's the first time all file that's being downloaded.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.500
That took 13 milliseconds.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.600
It was only 200 and 19 bytes pretty small.

02:17.610 --> 02:26.320
We downloaded some script files and also our nice puppy image.

02:26.500 --> 02:31.100
And there's a similar response now within here.

02:31.150 --> 02:32.620
I want you to look at a few options.

02:32.620 --> 02:39.680
I'm going to clear this one is that most likely your users aren't going to be on superfast connections

02:40.280 --> 02:46.130
so you can actually change this to something like slow 3G connection so that the network will be a little

02:46.130 --> 02:47.330
bit slower.

02:47.330 --> 02:50.140
Now keep in mind that browsers are constantly evolving.

02:50.150 --> 02:54.300
So this might now look the same to you when you watch this video.

02:54.590 --> 02:58.230
But they should still have these features somehow.

02:58.460 --> 03:00.450
So was slow 3G connection.

03:00.520 --> 03:07.640
You want to disable cache so that is if a browser automatically remembers this image that we've downloaded

03:07.640 --> 03:14.360
sold be faster the next time I refresh but if I disable cache it's going to reinstalled or re download

03:14.360 --> 03:15.890
these images all the time.

03:17.470 --> 03:18.880
I can also change the view

03:21.570 --> 03:26.380
and I can also filter things based on what I'm interested in.

03:26.450 --> 03:35.000
But again for now if I do a refresh or I always like doing a hard to reload to make sure that everything

03:35.000 --> 03:39.410
gets loaded you'll see that with a 3G network.

03:39.650 --> 03:46.700
Things are moving a little bit slower quite slow actually.

03:46.730 --> 03:52.790
So right away I noticed that this Web site if somebody is viewing it on really bad internet connection

03:52.790 --> 03:59.510
on their mobile phone while there are going to be really really annoyed with me because everything is

03:59.510 --> 04:03.220
just moving at a snail's pace.

04:03.830 --> 04:08.490
But the cool thing is you see over here the waterfall and what the browser is doing.

04:08.540 --> 04:13.640
We see that it's downloading right now the large background and the puppy JPAC and you see that it's

04:13.640 --> 04:21.090
taken a lot of time and that the request is not a finished yet but so far it's been taking 32 seconds.

04:21.120 --> 04:21.960
That's crazy.

04:23.290 --> 04:28.660
You can see over here you can play around with this tool get a little bit more information about what

04:28.780 --> 04:29.800
your Web site is doing.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.890
But as you can see this is pretty terrible.

04:32.920 --> 04:37.440
So I want to improve this using some of the settings that I've shown you.

04:37.540 --> 04:42.580
Let's try and improve this simple web site so that this doesn't happen anymore.

04:43.510 --> 04:47.960
All right I'll see in the next video shot by.
