Hey it's Bruno here again.

00:03.210 --> 00:04.560
Hope you had a good weekend.

00:04.570 --> 00:12.420
Listen we want some of our robo friends users to have a better experience with our Robur friends up.

00:12.420 --> 00:16.360
Could you take a look at the code and see how we can improve it.

00:16.500 --> 00:22.140
Also over the weekend I heard about this thing called progressive Web apps.

00:22.170 --> 00:27.090
Can we by any chance turn our robo friends up into a progressive Web app.

00:27.090 --> 00:29.520
I heard it's going to be pretty big.

00:29.520 --> 00:33.190
I heard he can even make though app work offline.

00:33.480 --> 00:34.920
Cool thanks.

00:35.040 --> 00:39.660
Hey sweet sweater by the way oh boy.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.280
Here's another task for us.

00:42.280 --> 00:49.210
We need to see how we might want to improve our performance for our robo friends app and then finally

00:49.480 --> 00:53.060
turn it into a progressive Web app.

00:53.170 --> 00:59.380
We're going to use the knowledge from the previous sections to build upon this knowledge by using react

00:59.530 --> 01:00.490
and redux again.

01:01.900 --> 01:03.730
It's all you inside the section.

01:04.050 --> 01:04.710
Let's get dork.
