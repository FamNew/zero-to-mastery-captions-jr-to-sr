WEBVTT

00:02.230 --> 00:03.230
Welcome back.

00:03.520 --> 00:06.540
In this video we're going to talk about this first point.

00:06.670 --> 00:07.780
Yes.

00:08.230 --> 00:10.610
And why we needed for progress of webapps.

00:10.990 --> 00:19.670
Now progressive webapps have a certain checklist you can check out on the progressive Web app checklist.

00:19.850 --> 00:23.030
And I know I know I said that there isn't a checklist.

00:23.030 --> 00:28.970
Think of it think of progressive webapps as a running list but that's because these are probably going

00:28.970 --> 00:32.330
to get constantly updated and changed.

00:32.330 --> 00:37.860
Now this checklist as you go through it does look a little bit overwhelming.

00:38.890 --> 00:44.780
But we've been following good practices while building our apps just like we did with Robur friends

00:44.800 --> 00:48.200
up and we've actually done most of these things.

00:48.590 --> 00:58.800
So that's why instead of showing you this we only really need to focus on three main things that a progressive

00:58.880 --> 01:00.930
Web app needs to do.

01:01.140 --> 01:07.890
Now besides these There's a few features but the adoption for them such as Push Notifications haven't

01:07.890 --> 01:13.560
been that smooth or are still in the works.

01:13.560 --> 01:19.770
So for now we're going to focus on things that you can implement right now fully and be confident that

01:19.770 --> 01:22.190
they're going to work in your app.

01:22.230 --> 01:32.940
So yes HEG P.S. As you know since we mentioned it a little bit in the SSA section prevents bad actors

01:33.210 --> 01:41.750
from tampering with communications between our app and browser so that if we're sending let's say a

01:41.750 --> 01:49.940
user name and password to our server we can encrypt it so that that message that includes our password

01:50.180 --> 01:59.450
travels to the server in an encrypted fashion so that if Bob the evil third party hacker is trying to

01:59.630 --> 02:06.230
intercept the messages and read them even if he intercepts the message he won't understand it because

02:06.260 --> 02:07.750
it's encrypted.

02:08.120 --> 02:11.920
And again this is something that we talked about in my previous course.

02:11.960 --> 02:22.360
Now Google is really pushing for this TTP US encryption and if we go back to our Web sites we see that

02:23.100 --> 02:28.100
yes we have this little nice lock icon with secure.

02:28.310 --> 02:29.660
That's a good sign.

02:29.690 --> 02:34.910
Chrome has actually updated so that if you have any sort of forms on your Web site and they're not a

02:34.910 --> 02:38.930
shitty B-S they'll show up here is not secure.

02:39.110 --> 02:42.650
Pretty much schaming Web sites for now using a DBMS.

02:42.650 --> 02:49.220
So anytime you're sending data from the Cline to the server you should be using a sheet to press.

02:49.250 --> 02:53.030
Now why do we need that though for progressive Web apps.

02:53.240 --> 02:58.370
And that is because progressive Web apps use some features that we're going to talk about in other videos

02:59.360 --> 03:08.230
that require Yes for security reasons although this is a requirement for progress of web app.

03:08.540 --> 03:14.240
In general you should always serve your web sites if there's any sort of communication with the server

03:14.690 --> 03:22.720
through and if we go to our lighthouse report you see that when you scroll to progressive Web app and

03:22.720 --> 03:28.810
we check out the nine past audits that we had we have uses HTP Yes.

03:28.960 --> 03:32.710
As one of the requirements but how did that happen.

03:32.710 --> 03:34.960
How do we have a DiPiazza ready.

03:34.990 --> 03:41.350
And luckily for us we get this out of the box with get how pages you can see over here that this link

03:41.350 --> 03:50.410
that was generated is a GTP s so any time you put a website on how pages we automatically get this encryption

03:51.040 --> 03:52.870
which is fantastic.

03:55.030 --> 04:02.080
Not all web sites can be hosted on get pages you probably want to have your own server your own domain

04:02.080 --> 04:13.660
name well the easiest way to get HEG piece is probably through Let's encrypt let's encrypt is a free

04:14.120 --> 04:21.380
and in rights it says over here it's a free automated and open certificate authority and they're fantastic

04:21.530 --> 04:29.300
to use and a certificate authority is just this authority that says I'll give you a certificate to certify

04:29.330 --> 04:36.710
that yes you are indeed whoever you say you are whatever your domain name is and let's encrypt gives

04:36.710 --> 04:39.040
you free certificates.

04:39.230 --> 04:43.550
That is really really easy to set up and they have great documentation for you to use.

04:43.970 --> 04:45.970
I highly recommend them.

04:46.020 --> 04:54.210
You also have something like CloudFlare and CloudFlare is a Cdn or a content delivery network which

04:54.210 --> 04:57.440
we're going to talk about in later sections.

04:57.660 --> 05:03.870
But for now you can think of them as a server that you can put your files on and just like get pages

05:03.870 --> 05:14.370
that host your files on their servers CloudFlare hosts your site on their pages and automatically through

05:14.370 --> 05:16.210
them you get a sheet.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.270
Yes.

05:17.460 --> 05:23.880
And if you go to their pricing they're actually very very generous and there's a free plan for personal

05:23.880 --> 05:27.630
blog posts and any simple web sites that you have.

05:27.630 --> 05:33.180
Again I highly recommend them and they actually do improve your performance of the Web site as well.

05:33.180 --> 05:39.770
Again something that we'll get into and the performance part 3 Section going back to our Web site.

05:39.970 --> 05:46.740
This is something that we get out of the box our app is going to work with all the other features of

05:46.740 --> 05:54.720
progressive Web app because it's on pages and we automatically get this B.S. also and we can double

05:54.720 --> 06:04.610
check over here with prepacked hacker news that yep indeed they are using a sheet CPS as well.

06:05.730 --> 06:06.170
All right.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.680
That's it for now.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.200
I'll see you in the next one.

06:09.200 --> 06:09.710
Bye bye.
