Let's review we instructed our compose file to create a service called smart brain API.

00:08.750 --> 00:14.420
And this used the docket file by using the build.

00:14.420 --> 00:19.340
Otherwise we could use something like image and we would need this parameter.

00:19.340 --> 00:25.210
It mapped the containers internal ports 3000 to the Horst port.

00:25.220 --> 00:33.820
That is my computer and upon all the six fusion we run NPM start to start our server.

00:33.850 --> 00:41.450
We also learned about the command dock or compose run where we can run this service which will run the

00:41.450 --> 00:44.120
command that we have established here.

00:44.180 --> 00:51.150
However with Dharker compose run isn't that useful because we ideally have multiple services here.

00:52.240 --> 01:01.360
So instead of that we use something called Dharker compose up and dock or compose up allows us to bring

01:01.360 --> 01:06.940
up all the services that we have listed here and there will define all the services running by their

01:07.000 --> 01:09.220
container name as we have here.

01:09.670 --> 01:18.120
And right now even though we only have one service our back end API it's enough to show that it's working

01:18.330 --> 01:22.230
and how we can now add more things to this file.

01:23.490 --> 01:31.770
Now you may notice one issue here and that is the fact that any time we make a change to our file like

01:32.220 --> 01:40.000
when we added Morgan we had to rebuild everything rerun everything to get us up and running.

01:43.620 --> 01:53.340
For example if I go to server dodginess and let's say in here I'll just do a console log of check this

01:53.340 --> 02:02.060
doesn't refresh gnomon isn't really watching this change because these files that I changed is on my

02:02.180 --> 02:08.580
local machine not on the container but there's a way for us to fix this problem.

02:08.780 --> 02:13.200
We go back to dock or compose I can add volume

02:15.790 --> 02:23.580
and within the volumes I can give it my current directory on my local machine which in which case will

02:23.580 --> 02:26.080
be this the root directory.

02:26.080 --> 02:33.860
And we want it to be mapped to the working directory that we have in the container right here.

02:33.920 --> 02:40.580
And if you remember volume's allows us access to the file system of the dock or container where the

02:40.580 --> 02:42.270
dock or container is.

02:42.290 --> 02:51.290
So this way by copying or by having these files mapped to where the container is the container file

02:51.290 --> 02:56.010
system is going to see the changes and update gnomon.

02:56.130 --> 02:57.610
So let's save here.

02:57.630 --> 03:03.090
I'm going to close and again run NPM or duck compose up dash dash.

03:03.100 --> 03:03.490
Bill

03:11.120 --> 03:15.650
I get the check command but that's because I rebuilt it if I changed this to

03:20.480 --> 03:27.740
look that it's listening to changes now and I can update my file and the docker container is going to

03:27.740 --> 03:28.810
update with it.

03:29.660 --> 03:34.610
Volumes is a bit of a complex topic and I'll leave for a nice resource for you to read.

03:34.670 --> 03:42.350
But just think of volumes as a way to have a connection or mounting whatever we have on our computer

03:42.860 --> 03:46.230
to the doctor container.

03:46.300 --> 03:52.870
But for now we have some nice setup with the back and I think we need to add our postscripts.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.930
Finally I'll see in the next one by.
