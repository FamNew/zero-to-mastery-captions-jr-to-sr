00:01.940 --> 00:09.320
This is something that we started our course with the idea that when learning something with our limited

00:09.470 --> 00:16.680
time and resource we need to make sure that we understand the most important concept.

00:17.540 --> 00:20.300
Why are we learning this.

00:20.340 --> 00:28.340
Why is this worth my time and why is this something that I should dedicate this time to.

00:28.400 --> 00:32.360
Too often we see new things in the developer ecosystem.

00:32.360 --> 00:38.270
It is always exciting to be working on the newest and shiniest thing that everybody is talking about.

00:38.570 --> 00:47.270
But remember those libraries and frameworks and configuration files and tools those things come and

00:47.270 --> 00:47.890
go.

00:48.150 --> 00:49.840
They're always changing.

00:50.270 --> 00:57.500
You can be a master of wet pack one day and two years later nobody cares because there's a better tool

00:57.500 --> 00:58.400
out there.

00:58.610 --> 01:06.340
The things that stick around are the fundamental computer science topics and software development practices.

01:06.380 --> 01:07.030
Sure.

01:07.040 --> 01:15.500
These things change over time as well but they always evolve slowly with Y in mind when learning new

01:15.500 --> 01:16.450
things.

01:16.490 --> 01:25.070
Make sure you understand why the solution was created what problem is it solving and why is this the

01:25.070 --> 01:27.270
answer to your problems.

01:27.470 --> 01:34.400
If you're able to do this you stop being a player in the game of catch up in the developer ecosystem.

01:34.580 --> 01:41.340
Always trying to learn the latest Larbi the newest tool the coolest functions to learn.

01:41.470 --> 01:46.570
It's like a game of hamster who's constantly trying to keep up with the wheel trying to run on that

01:46.570 --> 01:58.540
wheel but instead be an observer who is watching the ecosystem evolve from above watch how new libraries

01:58.570 --> 02:03.460
coming Go understand the why of each libraries what problems they solve.

02:03.490 --> 02:11.050
Understand the big picture why we do things but be the observer not the hamster.

02:12.040 --> 02:15.400
You'll have a happier longer career overall.

02:15.400 --> 02:21.060
Trust me you won't be constantly trying to catch up with every library and framework this way.

02:21.750 --> 02:28.760
This big picture vision is what makes a senior developer or a manager or a leader.

02:29.710 --> 02:31.610
They don't have narrow vision.

02:32.020 --> 02:38.100
They see the entire ecosystem and they're able to make smart decisions because of that.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.950
So always start with why.
