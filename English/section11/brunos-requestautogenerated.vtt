Hey there champ it's Bruno again.

00:04.350 --> 00:09.120
Listen our developers are getting frustrated with the local devolvement.

00:09.120 --> 00:15.840
They always have to set up the server then run the postscripts database and make sure that their users

00:15.840 --> 00:17.810
in the database that they can task.

00:17.910 --> 00:22.170
And it's really slowing us down in our development.

00:22.170 --> 00:24.480
I heard you know how to use daquiri though.

00:24.480 --> 00:30.360
Can you set up our backend so that it uses docker this way with one command we can run all of our back

00:30.360 --> 00:32.400
end services at once.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.150
It will make our lives so much easier.

00:35.220 --> 00:37.000
Everybody would really appreciate it.

00:37.960 --> 00:38.940
Thanks as always.

00:38.950 --> 00:40.800
By the way Nice sunglasses.

00:42.230 --> 00:46.980
Here we go again docker is an intimidating topic at first.

00:47.270 --> 00:53.120
However using containers which is what docker allows you to do has changed the landscape of how some

00:53.120 --> 00:55.610
of the biggest tech companies are working today.

00:55.960 --> 01:01.670
In this section we're going to create our own containers and finally learn the powers of docker.

01:01.790 --> 01:05.590
I guarantee you that you will be blown away by its bar by the end of it.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.390
So let's get started.

01:07.760 --> 01:08.000
Oh my.
