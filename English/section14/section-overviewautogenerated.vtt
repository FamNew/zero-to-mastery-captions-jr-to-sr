00:01.880 --> 00:10.640
Welcome to the aid of your s section of the Course AWOS or Amazon Web Services is something provided

00:10.640 --> 00:12.360
by the company Amazon.

00:12.830 --> 00:19.910
You see over the years they've grown to a very very large size and because of that they have a lot of

00:19.910 --> 00:20.600
servers.

00:20.720 --> 00:27.380
A lot of machines and they've become really really good at managing these machines and making sure that

00:27.380 --> 00:28.340
they work together.

00:29.380 --> 00:36.370
And a few years back they discovered that this expertise of being able to manage machines and making

00:36.670 --> 00:41.840
large scale applications is a skill that a lot of people wanted.

00:42.070 --> 00:52.160
So they created this service Amazon Web Services to help people by letting us in a sense rent some of

00:52.160 --> 00:59.210
their services so that we can run on the same platform same infrastructure that Amazon runs on a massive

00:59.210 --> 01:00.640
massive e-commerce company.

01:01.890 --> 01:07.200
And in this section we're going to learn all about that you see with AWOS.

01:07.220 --> 01:13.250
You can select the specific solutions you need and only pay for exactly what you use.

01:14.420 --> 01:19.180
So you don't have to worry about buying the equipment managing everything.

01:19.640 --> 01:22.090
You see Amazon owns all of that.

01:22.100 --> 01:26.960
All you need to worry about is make sure that you send them the right code you connect the pieces together

01:27.440 --> 01:29.640
and they'll run everything for you.

01:30.420 --> 01:35.880
And this means that you're going to have lower capital spending or you're going to spend a lot less

01:35.880 --> 01:42.060
money setting everything up yourself as well as having faster time to actually start deploying your

01:42.060 --> 01:49.560
application and your application because it runs on Amazon's services is already out of the gate for

01:49.560 --> 01:58.460
performance and scaling some things that we really really value and more and more companies are starting

01:58.460 --> 02:07.070
to build their infrastructure partially or entirely in the cloud with Amazon Web Services and you'll

02:07.070 --> 02:14.870
hear the term on premise or an arm pram data center and that's when you had like I said before your

02:14.870 --> 02:19.960
own servers your own machines and this is becoming less and less common.

02:20.060 --> 02:28.220
We just let big companies like Amazon Google or Microsoft handle this for us and the cloud now ensures

02:28.490 --> 02:36.590
the reliability compliance security standards and the ability to Insley grow and shrink our infrastructure

02:36.830 --> 02:39.560
to meet our needs based on our app.

02:39.590 --> 02:46.540
It just gets rid of a ton of headaches and it's growing like crazy because of the obvious benefits.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.130
Now why do we need this again.

02:50.570 --> 02:56.390
Well remember our application that we're trying to build our smart brain app we have all these connecting

02:56.390 --> 03:01.290
pieces and looking at all of this that's a lot of engineering time.

03:01.490 --> 03:04.880
I mean we have to set up rattus because.

03:04.910 --> 03:11.270
Yeah and of all men we can have everything under one container but in reality in production we need

03:11.270 --> 03:17.810
to make sure that they can scale and that we perhaps put them in different geographical location if

03:17.810 --> 03:22.450
we have users from different parts of the world that need to have servers close to them.

03:22.840 --> 03:30.710
And we might need to manage databases and perhaps do things like shorting or adding extra data bases

03:31.550 --> 03:38.640
we might want to add load balancers and it just adds a lot of complexity to why we need to do with Ada.

03:38.650 --> 03:43.070
Yes they take care of some of these pain points for us.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.300
You want to load balancer.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.660
They'll take care of it.

03:45.710 --> 03:52.120
You want databases to be just automatically scalable as users and data grows.

03:52.160 --> 03:56.630
They can do that for you and all these things are done out of the box.

03:56.630 --> 04:00.440
All we do is provide them the code some configuration.

04:00.620 --> 04:01.730
And you're all set.

04:02.600 --> 04:06.000
Now there are two other platforms that are quite big.

04:06.170 --> 04:11.750
Actually four if you really want to get into it obviously we've talked about Amazon but there's also

04:12.170 --> 04:18.470
Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud platform or GCP for short.

04:18.470 --> 04:22.870
There's also IBM that's in the market but these are the top three right now.

04:23.030 --> 04:29.690
And all of them are competing for this massive massive market share and they're trying to each do one

04:29.690 --> 04:30.650
another.

04:30.740 --> 04:32.240
And how do they do that.

04:32.570 --> 04:39.320
Well each of them have a lot of machines a lot of servers and a lot of expertise in managing these massive

04:39.320 --> 04:47.920
massive scale but they try to differentiate themselves by offering different services and then the next

04:47.920 --> 04:52.550
video we're going to talk about some of the services that Amazon offers.

04:52.960 --> 04:59.680
And Microsoft and Google also offer some of these services but also offer some of the unique ones.

04:59.800 --> 05:06.220
So as a user as a developer you can pick and choose based on what type of service you need to decide

05:06.220 --> 05:07.340
for yourself.

05:07.900 --> 05:13.480
I should go with one of them and it's become easier and easier to just transfer and change services

05:13.980 --> 05:14.910
as you want.

05:15.340 --> 05:21.610
So in the next video let's tackle some of the services to have a better idea of what this whole infrastructure

05:21.610 --> 05:24.930
as a service platform as a service means.
