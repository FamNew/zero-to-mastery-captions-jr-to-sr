Hey it's Bruno here.

00:03.310 --> 00:05.180
But I'm so glad I hired you.

00:05.190 --> 00:11.150
Listen I've noticed that we haven't really written any test for our robo friends up.

00:11.310 --> 00:18.390
I'm afraid that as our company and product grows we're going to run into problems where we introduce

00:18.390 --> 00:20.790
bugs to the code.

00:20.790 --> 00:24.990
Can we help with our unit test and improve our code coverage.

00:26.210 --> 00:27.510
Great thanks.

00:27.530 --> 00:30.620
By the way love your shoes today.

00:30.630 --> 00:31.530
All right.

00:31.620 --> 00:35.250
Another task from Bruno in this section.

00:35.400 --> 00:41.850
We're going to learn about testing and the testing environment and the Web development land.

00:41.890 --> 00:46.770
There's a lot of tools and a lot of things that go into testing.

00:46.970 --> 00:48.840
But we're going to focus on the why.

00:48.940 --> 00:50.520
Why is testing important.

00:50.560 --> 00:51.990
Why do we need it.

00:52.030 --> 00:57.430
And then finally go through some tests that we're going to write ourselves and improve our robo friends

00:57.430 --> 01:06.030
up so that in the future as the app grows and as the developer team grows we can avoid bugs.

01:06.050 --> 01:06.850
I'll see you inside.
