00:01.940 --> 00:03.510
We're going to start using Gawker.

00:03.530 --> 00:09.500
But before we do that we need to do a quick install on our computer so we have access to docker.

00:09.900 --> 00:17.090
Again I'm using a Mac here but I'll leave resources so you can do this on Windows and Linux machines

00:17.150 --> 00:17.900
as well.

00:17.900 --> 00:26.990
So don't worry all we need to do is if we just type installing docker we have our installed docker documentation.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.470
It should be the first thing that comes up on Google.

00:30.720 --> 00:37.250
And here if you scroll down to desktop these are the two options that you have.

00:37.290 --> 00:40.890
One is docker for Mac or dock or for Windows.

00:40.950 --> 00:50.600
Nice and simple if you are running Linux then you might have to go a little bit down down to something

00:50.600 --> 00:58.410
like Dr E or Dockerty and download with the with your distribution of Linux.

00:58.430 --> 01:01.080
Again I'll leave resources for you to follow.

01:01.130 --> 01:06.720
If that is the case but for Mac and Windows do one of these.

01:06.820 --> 01:09.400
It's docker for Mac and Daka for Windows.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.680
Very nice and simple to install.

01:11.800 --> 01:19.910
All we need to do is just simply download this package and added to our application folders.

01:20.330 --> 01:26.110
Again just by clicking download you'll be able to get Dr..

01:26.210 --> 01:29.140
Now I already have it installed for myself.

01:29.630 --> 01:36.720
So all I need to do is open up the docker application see that we have a new version.

01:36.750 --> 01:40.560
Will do that later and I have Dharker up and running now.

01:40.590 --> 01:42.870
You can see that daquiri is starting.

01:43.390 --> 01:48.510
And now we just have to give it a bit of time while it starts and once it's ready.

01:48.630 --> 01:53.550
This building is going to show me a green light and that means we're good to go.

01:53.550 --> 01:57.980
Good to use Dr where your doctor is running.

01:58.330 --> 02:05.710
And now that we have docker installed we now have access to some comments in our terminal and we're

02:05.740 --> 02:13.010
able to create containers and run containers niceties right in the next videos we're going to start

02:13.010 --> 02:16.260
creating our own images and learning some darker commands.

02:16.670 --> 02:21.230
So get your doctor set up on your machine and I'll see you in the next one.

02:21.590 --> 02:21.820
Bye bye.
