00:02.180 --> 00:07.880
Security is one of those things that everyone talks about being important.

00:07.880 --> 00:09.950
We all know that security is important.

00:10.010 --> 00:10.480
Right.

00:11.370 --> 00:19.350
I mean we've had security breaches where users passwords or leaked databases are compromised and hackers

00:19.560 --> 00:22.280
attack Web sites pretty much every day.

00:22.560 --> 00:33.870
Companies from Linked-In Yahoo Equifax and many many many more are attacked by hackers and bad actors.

00:33.920 --> 00:37.740
We know we should have good security with our applications.

00:37.940 --> 00:40.730
But what does that mean.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.370
Nobody really tells you this.

00:42.410 --> 00:47.180
Do they this section will cover this very important topic.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.290
That is security.

00:51.370 --> 00:57.030
But let's talk about the big elephant in the room.

00:57.030 --> 01:05.310
Security is kind of like playing defense in soccer if you're in North America or football if you're

01:05.310 --> 01:06.690
everywhere else in the world.

01:06.810 --> 01:09.690
Now for those that don't play soccer or football.

01:09.690 --> 01:11.060
Please forgive me.

01:11.520 --> 01:15.630
But security is like a defenseman in soccer.

01:15.630 --> 01:22.710
Your job is really important as you have to defend the opponent from scoring on you but you never get

01:22.710 --> 01:28.820
the glory that a striker or a forward does who scores goals for your team.

01:30.950 --> 01:35.660
You only wish you had good security after you get hacked.

01:35.690 --> 01:42.770
You don't see the benefits of security until after you lose money because when you increase something

01:42.770 --> 01:47.650
like performance of a website you can immediately see it.

01:47.780 --> 01:50.020
Your boss loves you.

01:50.030 --> 01:54.660
We've improved the performance of Keiko Corp and Bruno loves us.

01:54.920 --> 02:04.610
But if you build a secure application Well nothing happens because that's the goal you are trying to

02:04.610 --> 02:11.720
create something that is stable secure and won't cause major issues in the future.

02:12.020 --> 02:18.920
But it is hard for people to see the value in it especially for those just looking at company growth.

02:18.920 --> 02:23.030
You see senior developers know this.

02:23.060 --> 02:31.250
They know that they get hired to make good decisions on projects and to keep it stable to keep it running.

02:32.550 --> 02:40.410
They can be trusted to add security best practices to their apps without being told because they keep

02:40.470 --> 02:42.990
everything nice and smooth and running.

02:44.630 --> 02:51.680
When they build projects their projects doesn't blow up with huge issues or cause massive financial

02:51.680 --> 02:54.650
loss or loss in customer trust.

02:54.650 --> 02:59.420
They can be trusted to build applications that just keep on running.

03:00.790 --> 03:08.650
And as developers we also have a responsibility to build these applications securely because it isn't

03:08.650 --> 03:11.540
just a company that may be affected.

03:11.740 --> 03:16.180
It could be its customers and many other people involved.

03:16.300 --> 03:22.570
So with this section we're going to talk about a topic that you can write numerous books on.

03:22.570 --> 03:31.570
Security is an ever evolving field as there are always people finding new and ingenious ways to attack

03:31.690 --> 03:33.840
a system.

03:33.870 --> 03:40.510
Now as we do with everything in the scores we're going to work efficiently What are the 80 percent of

03:40.510 --> 03:45.510
the issues that we can solve and security and be way ahead of the competition.

03:46.920 --> 03:52.250
Because you will never be 100 percent secure no program ever is.

03:52.240 --> 03:58.950
However we can make our applications resistant to most attacks quite easily by following some great

03:58.950 --> 03:59.940
guidelines.

04:00.880 --> 04:01.660
Are you excited.

04:02.820 --> 04:04.320
I'll see inside the section.

04:04.320 --> 04:05.210
Let's get started.
