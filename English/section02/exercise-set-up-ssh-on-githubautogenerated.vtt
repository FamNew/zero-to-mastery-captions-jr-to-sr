00:01.290 --> 00:02.400
Welcome back.

00:02.400 --> 00:08.520
Remember that first task that Bruno asked us to do which is set up S-sh on our account.

00:08.520 --> 00:12.030
Well let's do that in this exercise.

00:12.030 --> 00:18.750
Knowing what you know I've taught you way more than you needed to know with S-sh.

00:18.870 --> 00:21.150
Can you do this on your own.

00:22.910 --> 00:28.340
I'm going to provide a solution video for you after this but I really want to try setting this up.

00:28.430 --> 00:36.280
If you haven't done so S-sh with get help and I'm going to give you a little bit of a hint you see with

00:36.280 --> 00:37.250
Digital Ocean.

00:37.300 --> 00:39.640
I went a little bit of the hard way.

00:39.760 --> 00:47.370
I showed you how you can log into the server and actually populate the authorized keys.

00:48.400 --> 00:56.730
With your public key but they don't actually expect you or everybody all their customers to do that

00:56.850 --> 01:00.340
manually because it is a little bit technical.

01:00.360 --> 01:07.270
You can actually go into their dashboard go to security and you can see over here they can add S-sh

01:07.270 --> 01:07.590
keys

01:10.620 --> 01:16.070
and just like that get hub makes it really really easy for us to add S-sh keys.

01:16.150 --> 01:24.350
We simply go to settings and within settings you'll have S-sh and you can see over here I've already

01:24.350 --> 01:25.780
set it up for myself.

01:25.940 --> 01:35.220
But knowing why you know you should be able to set up an S-sh key and at the end of all this.

01:35.340 --> 01:43.360
Why was this important why do we want to S-sh use S-sh with get up.

01:43.450 --> 01:55.860
I mean if we go into one of our projects let's go to Star here guidelines both DBMSs and S-sh are secure

01:55.860 --> 01:57.940
protocols that are encrypted.

01:58.110 --> 02:05.430
Now there's a few pros and cons HGP apps will always verify the server automatically using something

02:05.430 --> 02:07.140
called certificate authorities.

02:08.030 --> 02:15.020
But you also need passwords every time you connect to get up in time you want to clone or repo with

02:15.020 --> 02:16.110
a GPS.

02:16.160 --> 02:24.650
They'll last you for a password and when you work with good hub a lot making daily changes daily commits

02:25.090 --> 02:30.010
pool requests it can get tedious with S-sh.

02:30.320 --> 02:34.830
We're using a more secure way than passwords we're using keys.

02:35.120 --> 02:38.870
And since he can add many keys to the same account.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.680
For example we can create keys for each of the computers that we access.

02:42.680 --> 02:43.950
Get help to.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.700
It makes things a lot easier.

02:47.090 --> 02:55.940
Even on the server and on Digital Ocean I could have added many more keys or trusted keys.

02:55.950 --> 02:56.590
All right.

02:56.730 --> 03:01.470
So is time to set up S-sh with get up based on your knowledge.

03:01.470 --> 03:04.400
Try to set it all by yourself and don't worry.

03:04.410 --> 03:10.240
Like I said in the next video I'll show you how I would've done it.
