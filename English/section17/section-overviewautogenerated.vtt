Going to the X sure bet section.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.530
These are just small tiny videos that I thought were important to add to this course.

00:10.760 --> 00:13.860
And I think they'll be useful to you.

00:14.150 --> 00:19.910
However I want to give you a bit of a heads up here before we get started in this section.

00:20.150 --> 00:25.420
I want to warn you that these are just going to be my opinions.

00:25.580 --> 00:32.450
It's important to not blindly follow but form your own opinions based on your experience.

00:32.450 --> 00:35.810
It doesn't mean that I'm always right or I'm 100 percent right.

00:35.870 --> 00:43.850
However taking these opinions from others like myself will be useful since this is something I myself

00:43.850 --> 00:44.730
certainly did.

00:44.780 --> 00:52.170
I learned from my teachers from my mentors but I want you to also form your own opinion your own worldview.

00:53.190 --> 00:57.800
I'm going to speak from my experience but you will have a different experience as well.

00:58.230 --> 01:05.760
So with that in mind take these next videos not as fact but simply an opinion of somebody who has been

01:05.760 --> 01:07.340
in the industry for a while.

01:08.150 --> 01:14.480
These are my personal notes of what I think it takes to be someone truly great as a software developer

01:15.420 --> 01:19.020
something I myself am constantly working on.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.000
I hope you enjoy these videos.

01:22.170 --> 01:23.590
I'll see in the next one.

01:23.670 --> 01:24.120
Bye bye.
