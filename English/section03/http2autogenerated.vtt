I wanted to give you a quick note on something called HTP too.

00:07.160 --> 00:16.790
Up until now we've talked about HGP And that's actually a sure to be one issue GP 2 is a protocol update

00:16.910 --> 00:25.340
that's still compatible with GGP but its main goal is to improve network latency something that we've

00:25.340 --> 00:29.310
talked about how fast we can deliver files back and forth.

00:30.070 --> 00:37.940
From server to the client and in our discussion of combining texting graphics I wanted to point out

00:37.940 --> 00:42.900
that HTP too may change how you consider combining resources.

00:43.100 --> 00:50.580
For example the techniques we've discussed like minification compression image optimization should definitely

00:50.580 --> 00:53.070
be continued with HTP too.

00:53.220 --> 01:01.020
However physically combining files into a bundle as discussed above might not achieve the desired results

01:01.320 --> 01:06.120
with a sheet too because of something called multiplexing.

01:06.130 --> 01:10.510
This is primarily because server requests are faster on HTP too.

01:10.620 --> 01:20.190
So combining Faisel eliminate a request may not be actually substantially faster and the features of

01:20.260 --> 01:25.430
HGP too are definitely worth exploring and there's many many things.

01:25.530 --> 01:27.390
It's binary instead of textual.

01:27.540 --> 01:29.430
It's fully multiplexed.

01:29.430 --> 01:33.630
In theory it can have one connection for something called parallelism.

01:33.630 --> 01:39.300
So with one connection I have many many files sent to it.

01:39.300 --> 01:45.660
It also allows for something called Server push but I'm going to list some resources for you to follow.

01:45.690 --> 01:48.080
If you want to read more by should keep it too.

01:48.260 --> 01:50.520
It's still not widely adopted yet.

01:50.550 --> 01:51.950
It definitely will.

01:52.380 --> 01:58.410
As with anything in technology and definitely in web development things evolve and strategies evolve.

01:58.620 --> 02:04.240
So keep that in mind and definitely check out HGP to by the way if you're curious.

02:04.350 --> 02:08.540
How do I implement a server with HTP too.

02:08.930 --> 02:10.970
Well it's quite easy actually.

02:11.070 --> 02:15.260
This is actually a Notes server that I just created.

02:15.390 --> 02:23.190
And if you're using Knode above version a point a point one you'll have this and you'll be able to use

02:23.190 --> 02:32.570
the TTP to to create a server and deliver files through that protocol.

02:32.730 --> 02:39.150
Again it's always good to keep an eye out on new and evolving technologies and I hope you find the resources

02:39.250 --> 02:41.360
after this video useful.

02:41.430 --> 02:42.350
I'll talk to you soon.

02:42.560 --> 02:42.840
Bye bye.
