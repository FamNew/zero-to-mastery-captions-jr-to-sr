Sessions and authentication are an important part of an hour.

00:06.970 --> 00:14.770
Any time you have users and sign in and registration in and out you have to manage this you have to

00:14.770 --> 00:21.400
make sure that users can sign in to your app they can view their profile and their profile only and

00:21.640 --> 00:27.280
that when they refresh the page and if they're already signed in there still sign and then up.

00:27.280 --> 00:32.760
That's where we expect that's a typical behavior in any app that you have to be a member of.

00:32.770 --> 00:36.400
And in this day and age that's most webapps.

00:36.610 --> 00:42.250
So you'll find yourself having to build session management over and over and over again.

00:42.370 --> 00:48.790
It's an important skill to develop because if you do it incorrectly you have issues like users not being

00:48.790 --> 00:56.050
able to log into a now or even users having the ability to access parts of a Web site that they shouldn't

00:56.050 --> 00:58.430
have access to.

00:58.430 --> 01:08.520
So in this section Gardner learn about JWT and sessions and JWT stands for Jason whapped opens.

01:08.620 --> 01:11.130
Don't worry we're going to learn all about that.

01:11.440 --> 01:18.460
But the main purpose of this section is to learn how to have protected and protected routes where we're

01:18.460 --> 01:27.250
able to have users authenticate into our app receive a token back from the server in order for them

01:27.250 --> 01:35.020
to use this token to access whatever they have rights to access such as their profile and also makes

01:35.020 --> 01:36.480
changes to that profile.

01:36.670 --> 01:41.740
By the end of it you're going to be able to take this knowledge and manage sessions in a secure and

01:41.740 --> 01:43.470
efficient manner.

01:43.480 --> 01:48.930
It is a complex topic but a really fun one when you have everything finally working together.

01:49.420 --> 01:55.510
So be patient because we're going to get there the way we're going to start this section is by learning

01:55.510 --> 02:02.950
a few basics then actually building out a profile page on our smart brain now where a user can log in

02:02.950 --> 02:09.100
and modify their profile and we're going to incorporate sessions into that so that users are able to

02:09.280 --> 02:14.020
only access their own profile their profile only and not other people's profile.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.760
Let's keep on learning.

02:16.760 --> 02:18.500
I'll see you in the next video.

02:18.500 --> 02:18.920
Bye bye.
