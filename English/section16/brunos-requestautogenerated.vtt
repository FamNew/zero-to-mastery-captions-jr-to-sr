Listen I know I've been asking you a lot of things lately and you've really stepped up to the plate

00:06.030 --> 00:13.560
and have helped us out tremendously here at Kaikohe Corp. and I have one last thing that I want to ask

00:13.560 --> 00:16.350
and pretty please can you help us out.

00:16.380 --> 00:22.950
You see our team is growing and I've realized that we've never implemented continuous integration or

00:22.950 --> 00:26.060
even continuous delivery into our process.

00:26.100 --> 00:30.480
And because we're hiring more and more developers it's getting a little bit harder.

00:30.480 --> 00:36.980
Our codebase is not consistent because we have all these developers adding in their own piece of code

00:36.990 --> 00:40.030
and I think we really really need this process.

00:40.030 --> 00:45.260
It's something that we probably should have set up when we first started the company but we just a have

00:45.270 --> 00:51.470
time so can you help us out and perhaps fix some things for us and add continuous integration.

00:51.630 --> 00:53.390
It would really really mean a lot.

00:53.760 --> 00:54.440
Yeah.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.080
Cool.

00:55.140 --> 00:55.730
Thanks.

00:55.740 --> 00:58.010
Really appreciate it.

00:58.020 --> 01:01.910
By the way you have really good posture must be doing yoga or something.

01:04.220 --> 01:04.850
All right.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.010
Here we go.

01:06.020 --> 01:13.450
Our last task for Kaikohe Corp. That is to implement continuous integration into their process.

01:13.490 --> 01:14.610
What does that mean.

01:14.630 --> 01:15.970
How do we do it.

01:15.980 --> 01:21.380
We're going to cover that in this section and we're going to finish things off and complete our overall

01:21.380 --> 01:30.160
picture of a modern developer so that we have all the pieces in place for us to succeed in our career.

01:30.170 --> 01:31.160
Let's get started.
