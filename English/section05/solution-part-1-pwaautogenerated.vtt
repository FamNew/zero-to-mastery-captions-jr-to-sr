WEBVTT

00:01.080 --> 00:02.030
Walk them back.

00:02.190 --> 00:04.930
Let's start to make these numbers look a little bit better.

00:05.190 --> 00:10.980
And before we get to the progressive webapps score let's try and get the accessibility and ASIO's score

00:11.340 --> 00:12.530
to 100.

00:12.780 --> 00:21.890
If we scroll down we see that we have an X over here for Avoid invisible text while fonts are loading.

00:22.020 --> 00:26.430
Lighthouse does a great job of giving you resources to show you what to do.

00:26.610 --> 00:36.090
But essentially it's saying that if we're using the font family to download that really awesome font.

00:36.150 --> 00:38.900
Let's see the Sega Logo font.

00:39.210 --> 00:40.520
And you're using font face.

00:40.520 --> 00:48.840
Let me make this a little bit smaller then consider using the font display feature and you can learn

00:48.930 --> 00:50.630
more about it here.

00:51.380 --> 01:00.230
But the idea is that we want something like the swap property that swaps the font face in as soon as

01:00.230 --> 01:01.080
it loads.

01:01.370 --> 01:08.560
So this means that browsers draw out text immediately and when the font face is loaded it will swap

01:08.560 --> 01:08.720
it.

01:08.720 --> 01:15.140
So this way the user will see that what will see the rebel friends text on the screen a lot sooner.

01:15.170 --> 01:16.400
Let's do that.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.040
We're going to go here.

01:19.710 --> 01:29.160
And type in font display and we'll say swap and Lighthouse is really good at giving you pretty specific

01:29.160 --> 01:33.770
hints of what you can do with your app if we keep scrolling down.

01:33.770 --> 01:38.630
We'll skip over the progress of web app for now we see that for accessibility.

01:38.630 --> 01:45.280
They want the form elements to have Sosia labels.

01:45.390 --> 01:53.730
Now accessibility is a very important topic and this is why it's included in the Lyce House score because

01:54.030 --> 01:58.440
not everybody can view a web site regularly like you and I.

01:58.500 --> 02:05.310
Some people might need screen readers or might have to access web sites in different ways and by creating

02:05.310 --> 02:11.850
your web site or a web app in an accessible way that means you're opening it up to people to experience

02:11.850 --> 02:14.050
your website in different ways.

02:14.980 --> 02:16.720
Such as screen readers.

02:16.870 --> 02:23.650
So in our case you can read more about it here but we want to make sure that we let people know with

02:23.650 --> 02:26.400
screen readers what this input is about.

02:26.410 --> 02:30.580
We know that it's to search the robots and it actually gives you the line.

02:30.610 --> 02:39.890
Let's go back here to our card or to the search box where we have this input and in here we can add

02:39.890 --> 02:48.160
something called Aryeh label and we give this input a label that screen readers can use.

02:48.200 --> 02:56.750
And we'll just say search robots will say that and let's keep scrolling down.

02:57.220 --> 03:03.970
We also see here that for ex-CEO we have a document does not have a meta description.

03:04.450 --> 03:11.110
And if we click on here again we get a nice little description that says meto name description with

03:11.110 --> 03:14.150
content describing our Web site.

03:14.370 --> 03:21.540
And this is recommended practice for SEO so that when Web site crawlers read our Web site they can see

03:21.540 --> 03:26.070
the description tag and understand what our Web site is about.

03:26.070 --> 03:29.160
So let's go at that in our index.

03:29.190 --> 03:32.520
A shim alpha can just add it here.

03:33.560 --> 03:42.030
We'll describe our Web site and we'll say that where robots make Prince.

03:42.120 --> 03:42.950
All right.

03:43.380 --> 03:48.600
Let's go back to the report and everything else looks pretty good.

03:48.600 --> 03:56.490
We have some performance issues here such as we conserve images in next gen formats but that is the

03:56.520 --> 03:57.790
robot's images.

03:57.930 --> 04:04.170
And unfortunately because this is an API we don't have too much control over it unless we actually want

04:04.170 --> 04:07.290
to receive them beforehand and change them ourselves.

04:07.290 --> 04:10.360
But for now let's not do that.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.250
That's not too bad.

04:11.340 --> 04:16.680
But let's take a look at the images and how we might be able to optimize the if I go back to the Web

04:16.680 --> 04:21.060
site and I open up the network tab.

04:21.450 --> 04:24.080
Let's refresh your.

04:24.130 --> 04:26.480
I see all the robots coming in.

04:26.860 --> 04:35.490
And if I click on here I see that even though I said 200 by 200 I'm getting 300 pixels by 300 pixels.

04:35.680 --> 04:39.060
So we don't need those robots to have that big of an image.

04:40.020 --> 04:43.000
And this is a small error in the code.

04:43.200 --> 04:51.330
If we go here to the card component the API of roba hash access that we give it a query parameter of

04:51.690 --> 04:55.620
size because 200 by 200.

04:55.770 --> 05:04.720
So that now if we save and we're going to want to start because that is our deployed Web site you want

05:04.720 --> 05:14.770
to just run it locally for now let's open up the network tab and there you go.

05:14.780 --> 05:17.330
Our size is now 200 by 200.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.880
Robots are looking a little bit smaller but this is what we want looks good.

05:23.400 --> 05:23.790
Right.

05:23.840 --> 05:27.810
Let's run NPM run.

05:27.830 --> 05:31.350
Deploy and see what kind of score we get.

05:31.350 --> 05:40.860
Now now while this is running keep in mind that until the deploy is run and then gets published it might

05:40.860 --> 05:44.390
take a while to actually propagate to our website.

05:44.690 --> 05:46.320
It says published here now.

05:46.530 --> 05:58.830
But if I go to my app so the u r l and open up the tab and refresh we see that we're still getting the

05:58.830 --> 06:00.890
robots at 300 by 300.

06:00.900 --> 06:03.960
So the changes haven't propagated yet.

06:03.960 --> 06:09.390
So you have to wait a couple minutes for that to happen which is a little bit frustrating but hey it's

06:09.390 --> 06:11.250
a good chance for you to grab a cup tea.

06:11.620 --> 06:12.690
Let's refresh again.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.320
See if anything changes.

06:15.380 --> 06:15.710
No.

06:15.770 --> 06:16.290
All right.

06:16.340 --> 06:18.430
I am just going to keep waiting here.

06:21.530 --> 06:22.030
All right.

06:22.100 --> 06:24.320
And I'm back at him make me wait.

06:24.470 --> 06:25.180
It wasn't too bad.

06:25.190 --> 06:31.840
It was just like a minute wait but now I see that my robot images are the proper size.

06:32.090 --> 06:38.080
If I go into the console I still have a bit of a console lock here from the button but it's all right.

06:38.300 --> 06:42.130
Let's run the lighthouse score and see what happens.

06:49.760 --> 06:52.640
How great things are looking a lot better.

06:52.640 --> 06:58.520
We have a hundred for a CEO a hundred for accessibility a handler for best practices.

06:58.640 --> 07:04.700
We have our performance web app which or a progressive Web app which we definitely want to improve and

07:04.700 --> 07:07.490
a bit of a performance issue.

07:07.490 --> 07:14.120
If we actually make this a little smaller and compared to our numbers from before we see that we've

07:14.120 --> 07:18.380
definitely improved these two aspects which is great.

07:18.620 --> 07:27.120
And you might not even notice it but our images now are loading a lot faster.

07:27.130 --> 07:35.380
You can see that the issue is not to serve images in next Schempp format as it was before but now the

07:35.380 --> 07:38.380
biggest issue is reduce render blocking stylesheets.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.850
And we know about that right.

07:39.970 --> 07:48.670
If we click on here it says hey for critical resources consider adding the stealth tag in the HDMI file

07:48.910 --> 07:54.430
and just load the other one so you don't need later on but that's something that we've already done

07:54.430 --> 07:57.870
so we're not going to focus ourselves with by the way.

07:57.870 --> 08:03.960
If my internet connection was better I'll probably get 100 percent for this regardless because these

08:03.960 --> 08:05.020
times aren't too bad.

08:06.120 --> 08:09.220
But overall we've improved everything.

08:10.060 --> 08:14.210
We just need to improve our progress of app now.

08:14.350 --> 08:22.720
And looking at this I see that there are some unused rules in the stylesheet that I could perhaps also

08:22.990 --> 08:30.060
look into but that's something I can do on your own or you might want to see that.

08:30.140 --> 08:37.250
Well these robots because they're being rendered towards the end aren't actually needed until the user

08:37.250 --> 08:37.970
scrolls.

08:37.970 --> 08:44.150
Again that's something that we can do with above the fold loading but we've already talked about so

08:44.240 --> 08:45.300
in the next video.

08:45.380 --> 08:46.520
Let's focus on this.

08:46.610 --> 08:49.700
Let's make this a progressive webapp.

08:49.820 --> 08:50.440
I'll see in that one.
