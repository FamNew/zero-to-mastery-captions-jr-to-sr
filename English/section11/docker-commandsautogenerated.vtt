00:00.590 --> 00:07.720
Welcome back up to this point we learned to Dr. CLID comments that his command line interface there

00:07.810 --> 00:08.740
are pretty simple right.

00:08.740 --> 00:18.600
We had docker built and we gave it a tag to call our container something and then we did docker run

00:18.910 --> 00:20.740
and we ran our container.

00:20.920 --> 00:29.470
And because we used the I-T dash I-T parameter were able to go inside of that container and do all we

00:29.470 --> 00:30.240
want with it.

00:30.250 --> 00:37.240
For example if we had our project files from smart brain API I could have just done A.P.M. start there.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.990
If I had all those files.

00:39.430 --> 00:46.820
So again Doc built is used to build an image from the docker file that we created and then docker run

00:47.910 --> 00:49.580
again as the name suggests.

00:49.740 --> 00:55.400
Run the container and again each time it container's run Dharker assigns a new image hash.

00:55.440 --> 01:02.620
As we saw and we can confirm that we're actually running whatever we've whatever image reviews that

01:02.660 --> 01:07.150
we want to use something like node version or any of the commands that you might have.

01:07.320 --> 01:15.630
You can install Ubuntu for example and you can run Ubuntu commands like APT will list or app Dasch get

01:15.660 --> 01:21.800
to install things to make sure that your container actually is working as it's supposed to be.

01:21.810 --> 01:28.170
Now here's the thing with our container the way we have it we can't really do much can we we just have

01:28.170 --> 01:33.530
our node version and we can go into it and run commands from it.

01:33.540 --> 01:34.370
But that's it.

01:34.380 --> 01:35.880
It's pretty minimal right now.

01:36.710 --> 01:43.470
But like I said we can extend this and actually have our entire server running within this container.

01:44.570 --> 01:50.120
And as you saw because we're setting the environment here the node version we just give this container

01:50.120 --> 01:57.530
to anybody and anybody that has this dock or file will always make sure that the server runs the exact

01:57.530 --> 02:06.820
same way because everybody's using the same daquiri image now running the For go back to our terminal

02:06.850 --> 02:07.780
if we run

02:10.440 --> 02:12.440
our command every time.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.180
Well you might not want to actually go into the container.

02:15.180 --> 02:17.540
Be nice to be able to run it in the background.

02:17.820 --> 02:22.780
And the way we do this is we just give it another parameter which is Dashti.

02:23.550 --> 02:25.230
And here we have.

02:25.260 --> 02:25.890
There you go.

02:25.890 --> 02:29.910
Our container running in the background but we didn't go inside of it.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.900
Make sure we give that back.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.620
Luckily we didn't save it.

02:33.630 --> 02:40.560
Now we can run another command called Dr. p.s. and if we do that look at that and then you make this

02:40.560 --> 02:41.750
a little bit bigger.

02:41.790 --> 02:49.740
We can see all the containers that are currently running see our container I.D. our image names.

02:49.740 --> 02:55.080
See when it was created the status and also the commands that it's running.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.770
Very very cool.

02:57.810 --> 03:03.790
And you can have multiple multiple containers here and you can just check them out with Dr. p.s..

03:03.810 --> 03:04.270
All right.

03:04.310 --> 03:06.350
But now we have a problem.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.070
We have a container running in the background.

03:09.090 --> 03:13.770
How do we stop this or how can we go into it.

03:13.830 --> 03:22.320
Luckily once again we have a nother docker command that we can use which is dock or exec and by using

03:22.320 --> 03:30.580
the container idea or hash that we see over here we can reference this darker container because that's

03:30.580 --> 03:33.500
how daquiri can distinguish different containers.

03:33.700 --> 03:36.270
And by the way the alignments are a little bit off.

03:36.280 --> 03:39.120
But you see that this is container ID.

03:39.520 --> 03:44.400
And now in here I just do once again the I-T command.

03:44.430 --> 03:49.430
So think of it as getting us to go into the container.

03:49.440 --> 03:57.450
And then finally we give it the hash which we copied and then finally say that we want to access the

03:57.450 --> 03:59.410
back.

03:59.450 --> 03:59.980
There you go.

03:59.990 --> 04:04.730
We're back into the container and these commands I know they're hard to remember.

04:04.730 --> 04:06.410
You don't need to really remember them.

04:06.560 --> 04:11.920
You can always find them online or you can we watch this video whenever you need to use them.

04:12.110 --> 04:18.580
Now to stop this container now as you can imagine there's another command and it's pretty self-explanatory

04:18.590 --> 04:20.680
all we need to do is say stop.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.280
So let's accept this first.

04:22.280 --> 04:28.410
I'm going to just exit and then say Dr. P.S. We see that we have the container.

04:28.410 --> 04:37.000
Now all I need to do is say doctor stop and give it the hash of the container ID.

04:37.020 --> 04:37.920
All right.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.190
It looks like it worked if I do.

04:39.190 --> 04:42.690
Dr. P.S. We have nothing running now.

04:42.690 --> 04:43.540
Congratulations.

04:43.560 --> 04:50.280
You just learnt most of the tools you need to create containers and run containers and stop them.

04:50.340 --> 04:52.220
You can create as many containers as you want.

04:52.260 --> 04:56.850
Well as much as your your host the machine allows you to do.

04:57.330 --> 05:01.410
And now you've just become a container master.

05:01.410 --> 05:06.210
Well Ali starting to we have a few more things to cover in the next video.

05:06.210 --> 05:07.590
I'll see on that one.

05:07.780 --> 05:07.950
Bob.
