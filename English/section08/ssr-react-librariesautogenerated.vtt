SSR is still not a perfect solution with Klein side libraries and frameworks like angular react to view.

00:10.830 --> 00:16.620
Every time I've worked on a project where we had to implement server side rendering with these libraries

00:16.890 --> 00:22.740
it has increased the complexity of the app and it just has never felt right.

00:22.800 --> 00:26.900
It felt like trying to put a square block in a round hole.

00:26.910 --> 00:34.380
Now this is just my experience and yours may differ and you can definitely do server side rendering

00:34.380 --> 00:35.080
right.

00:35.190 --> 00:37.010
It's just a hard thing to do.

00:38.270 --> 00:44.720
But I want to show you two tools that I recommend and are extremely popular in the community for server

00:44.720 --> 00:51.920
side rendering just like create re-act app where we had a lot of the top developers working on this

00:51.920 --> 00:54.180
project to make our react.

00:54.230 --> 01:01.940
Easy to set up a lot of the top people in the field use these tools to implement server side rendering

01:02.120 --> 01:04.780
instead of reinventing the wheel yourself.

01:05.030 --> 01:06.480
And just like create re-act up.

01:06.530 --> 01:13.100
It avoids all the configuration so that you're actually able to focus on building your app instead of

01:13.100 --> 01:17.370
just setting things up and working on the configuration.

01:17.420 --> 01:19.470
So let's look at both of them.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.600
The first one is Gatsby.

01:21.690 --> 01:33.530
Yes and gaspy dodgy us is as you can see a blazing fast static site generator for react and Gatsby as

01:33.530 --> 01:39.830
it says is fantastic if you want to do server side rendering and you want static sites.

01:39.830 --> 01:43.540
You should be using Gatsby now.

01:43.900 --> 01:47.410
A static site if you remember is just like these.

01:47.410 --> 01:55.550
Re-act documentation here just mainly text based web sites that are really really good for things like

01:55.610 --> 02:04.730
documentation and as a matter of fact re-act uses Gatsby here to have their documentation.

02:05.060 --> 02:10.230
So if the official re-act documentations are using it you know that it's a great library.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.600
The second one is called Next.

02:14.680 --> 02:20.110
Yes and their version 5 right now but they're constantly updating it next.

02:20.280 --> 02:29.670
Yes unlike the Gatsby J.S. project which is a static site generator next to yes is a full dynamic tool

02:29.670 --> 02:32.310
to build rich applications.

02:32.310 --> 02:40.350
You can build in next J.S. what you could do on the client side with re-act really dynamic applications

02:40.350 --> 02:44.430
that go beyond just static text based websites.

02:44.430 --> 02:50.940
The cool thing with next guess is that instead of you having to implement render to string and implementing

02:50.970 --> 02:57.450
your own server side rendering with react it's very easy to use and they do all that for you and it's

02:57.450 --> 03:03.120
probably the best implementation of server side that I've seen and a lot of people in the community

03:03.120 --> 03:03.840
recommend it.

03:03.990 --> 03:09.600
You see with them you don't have to worry about setting up wet pack react to router for your routing

03:10.560 --> 03:14.060
react and react Dohm kind of like create react up.

03:14.070 --> 03:22.170
It's everything is included right out the box including code splitting including performance optimization

03:22.680 --> 03:25.040
and ACR optimization.

03:25.170 --> 03:32.860
Obviously they have things like hot module loading as well and prefetching And just so many things.

03:33.240 --> 03:35.610
It's a great gray library.

03:35.610 --> 03:42.150
And again some really smart people are working on this project so any time you use server side rendering

03:42.420 --> 03:43.770
I recommend you go with.

03:43.860 --> 03:44.470
Next stage.

03:44.490 --> 03:50.310
Yes and as a matter of fact in the next couple of videos I'm going to show you a quick demo of how to

03:50.310 --> 03:56.550
build a next JS app so I'll see in the next one play.
