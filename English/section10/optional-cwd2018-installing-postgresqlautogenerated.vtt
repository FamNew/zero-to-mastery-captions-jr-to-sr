00:02.070 --> 00:02.840
Welcome back.

00:02.850 --> 00:08.760
We're going to start setting up postscripts on our computer so that just like we did with servers of

00:08.770 --> 00:16.020
Front-End we're going to have a terminal that's running our front end and a back and that is running

00:16.020 --> 00:22.860
our server but also another terminal that is running a database because as you remember these are just

00:22.860 --> 00:28.880
computers running somewhere in the same way that we ran our server on our computer.

00:28.880 --> 00:35.440
We can also run our database on our computer and in this video we're going to get our set up with postscripts.

00:35.670 --> 00:38.690
Now Mongo D-B has gotten popular.

00:38.820 --> 00:44.950
However nothing beats a relational database for really developing your knowledge of databases.

00:44.970 --> 00:52.080
Once you understand relational databases it gives you really really good tools and mental models to

00:52.080 --> 00:56.550
work with Mongo D-B Mongo DD is very very simple.

00:56.670 --> 01:02.640
You can think of it as a face on data structure where we just have Jaison that looks like an object

01:03.030 --> 01:09.390
and we store that information there with as well and relational databases.

01:09.390 --> 01:11.000
It's more complex than that.

01:11.160 --> 01:17.060
So if you understand this you are miles ahead when it comes to understanding databases.

01:17.100 --> 01:23.660
So we're going to be focusing on that because the principles are still the same for Mongo D-B.

01:23.670 --> 01:23.990
All right.

01:24.050 --> 01:30.110
So let's get postscripts set up on our computer.

01:30.150 --> 01:34.840
The first thing we want to do is download something called a gooey.

01:34.860 --> 01:42.290
So a graphical user interface for postscripts and this exists for pretty much any database out there.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.000
I like PC quoll because it's free.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.050
It's really really good for Mac and it's very light and simple.

01:49.050 --> 01:55.500
I'll also make sure to add notes on how to download something like this and post postscripts in general

01:55.560 --> 02:00.480
if you're using a Windows machine but otherwise just click on the download link.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.050
Will be completely fast.

02:03.060 --> 02:08.290
Just open it up and you'll have something like this that are going to be using throughout the course.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.090
But there's many many options and can take a look for it.

02:11.280 --> 02:14.720
You just search for progress as well.

02:15.300 --> 02:23.380
And once the happy sequel installed you'll have it in your application folder and you can follow along.

02:23.380 --> 02:28.970
Now let's go back to the terminal in order to have postscripts installed there's many many ways and

02:28.970 --> 02:32.240
again I'll provide some notes on how you can do it.

02:32.480 --> 02:37.520
But the best way especially Omak is to use Brue which we've already talked about.

02:37.640 --> 02:44.240
Every time you do something with homebrew again it's a way to download packages from the Internet on

02:44.240 --> 02:45.310
your terminal.

02:45.320 --> 02:49.890
You always want to make sure that you do a brew update to make sure that everything is updated.

02:53.370 --> 02:59.730
And also a group doctor was just make sure everything is working on your system

03:03.780 --> 03:06.480
that's clear that perfect.

03:06.480 --> 03:12.470
Once you have that set up we're going to just say Brue install

03:14.970 --> 03:19.400
post-crisis skua and this will install for us.

03:19.620 --> 03:24.340
Postscripts and you see over here that I already have postcards installed.

03:24.340 --> 03:30.070
But if it's your first time Ill run through the commands and then actually at the end tell you exactly

03:30.070 --> 03:32.940
how to start using it.

03:33.020 --> 03:37.340
But in our case also Stelly will be much easier to start postscripts.

03:37.340 --> 03:46.800
You need to do brew services start postscripts and don't worry this isn't postscripts specific any database

03:46.820 --> 03:52.080
they are downloading you're essentially downloading the software and then you want to start the service.

03:52.190 --> 03:58.480
Each one has its own commands but it's as simple as Googling and figuring out how to run the database.

03:58.490 --> 04:02.880
So we've started postscripts Eskew all it looks like.

04:02.880 --> 04:12.810
I've already started the service and just to show you if I actually do stop here it will stop the terrorists

04:12.860 --> 04:13.250
service

04:16.040 --> 04:24.470
and just to start again and you can see that it's starting now in order for us to use postscripts we

04:24.470 --> 04:26.200
need to create a database.

04:26.630 --> 04:35.200
And the way we do that is to use the Create D-B command that has come up once we've installed postscripts.

04:35.380 --> 04:37.050
And here we can call it whatever we want.

04:37.090 --> 04:40.700
So let's call that test.

04:40.840 --> 04:44.400
It's going to create the D-B And there you go.

04:44.440 --> 04:45.810
Here's a quote part.

04:45.820 --> 04:53.010
If I go back to my PC he will open this up when we close this.

04:53.110 --> 04:55.420
I have over here piece sequel.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.880
And it asks for the host which is the link to where the database is located.

05:00.010 --> 05:04.160
In my case it's located at my localhost right.

05:04.180 --> 05:07.680
It's running on my computer.

05:07.770 --> 05:10.740
So you want it to be localhost and the port number.

05:10.740 --> 05:17.220
This is the default poor number of 5:43 to remember how we had port three thousand three thousand one

05:17.220 --> 05:19.250
for the front end and backend.

05:19.290 --> 05:20.150
It's similar to that.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.940
It's opening up a port for it to listen to a database.

05:23.160 --> 05:28.050
And this is the standard port for postscripts that you'll see.

05:28.050 --> 05:36.000
So when I did the Started progress and create D-B the default or 5 4 3 2 was already set.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.100
I can actually set what ports and change it up but we want to keep everything standard so we'll keep

05:41.100 --> 05:43.400
it the way it is.

05:43.550 --> 05:52.260
If I now go to the database and we call that tests so again we'll do test database hit connect.

05:52.270 --> 05:52.750
All right.

05:52.750 --> 05:58.840
We're connected to the database but there's not much in here as there.

05:59.090 --> 06:03.060
But at least we know that we're connected to localhost test.

06:03.160 --> 06:08.560
And another way to connect to this remember this is a gooey a graphical user interface and I'm showing

06:08.560 --> 06:12.760
you this because it's really good for demo purposes but I wanted to get comfortable working with the

06:12.760 --> 06:20.740
terminals well in order to do the same thing we just did with the Guti we can type in PSU Well again

06:20.740 --> 06:26.530
which is a command that we'll get when we install postscripts and we'll say which database we want to

06:26.530 --> 06:27.250
connect to.

06:27.340 --> 06:30.640
In our case will be the test.

06:30.830 --> 06:32.150
And there you go.

06:32.330 --> 06:34.990
Just like when we run node and it changes terminals.

06:35.000 --> 06:42.440
Now we're inside of postscripts that's running on our computer but we don't know any commands yet.

06:42.440 --> 06:48.850
Dewey So in the next video we're going to learn some bascule commands and finally create some tables

06:49.270 --> 06:51.070
in our postscripts database.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.780
I'll see that one by.
