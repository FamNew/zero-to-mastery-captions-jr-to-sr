WEBVTT

00:02.130 --> 00:07.460
All right let's make this provide a model look a little bit nicer than it is now.

00:10.700 --> 00:16.420
We're going to go back to my project here and come back to our profile.

00:16.430 --> 00:17.260
Dodgy Yes.

00:17.260 --> 00:19.520
I'm going to clean some of this up again.

00:20.960 --> 00:25.880
And just Doretti use some of the code that we already have.

00:26.450 --> 00:28.380
Let's have inside of here.

00:28.640 --> 00:37.930
Something similar to what we already had in our seinen page or we can even use the registration page.

00:38.210 --> 00:44.230
So let's open up the registration page and it's a big one for now just to keep things simple.

00:44.230 --> 00:54.340
I'm going to copy this comeback here and let's make this indentation better paste our code.

00:55.790 --> 00:56.440
That's a big one.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.370
Let's make this smaller.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.280
Let's see what that looks like.

01:00.320 --> 01:04.600
Go back the profile OK.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.070
Not bad.

01:06.100 --> 01:10.850
We got ourselves a bit of a profile page but we don't really want register we want to customize it with

01:11.420 --> 01:14.800
some of the profile elements that we want.

01:14.810 --> 01:18.110
So let's go ahead and do a bit of that bit of clean up.

01:18.170 --> 01:20.000
You're going to minimize this a little bit.

01:20.930 --> 01:23.340
For the article.

01:23.400 --> 01:27.260
Let's have the background be white.

01:27.300 --> 01:34.470
It's a little too see through right now to have more of a clear model look to it also give with let's

01:34.470 --> 01:35.610
say 80

01:38.280 --> 01:45.710
and I kind of want to have our profile icon on here so I can go back to my profile whereas our profile

01:45.710 --> 01:54.570
like on right here and just use this little image for now in the future you can imagine uploading users

01:54.900 --> 01:56.150
profile in this year.

01:56.190 --> 01:59.670
But for now just to keep things simple let's add this image

02:03.590 --> 02:07.690
and we'll move some of these CSSA styles again just to make it look good.

02:08.540 --> 02:16.960
And then we ideally perhaps want to have some H-1 tag that has the user name.

02:17.110 --> 02:30.080
It's all the say John Doe we maybe want to have a name for tag that says and says image sibbe knitted

02:30.080 --> 02:37.600
by our images submitted and this will have the number of count that they've submitted.

02:37.600 --> 02:44.520
Let's just say for now on these are things we're going to load up once be hooked into the basket and

02:44.520 --> 02:52.300
maybe we can have another thing that says that this user has been a member since I was just in January

02:52.310 --> 02:58.330
for now just something static and just to make things pretty maybe a horizontal line.

02:58.330 --> 03:04.990
All right let's start to remove some of these things that we don't need here so we can just remove the

03:04.990 --> 03:08.720
legend field set.

03:08.740 --> 03:15.130
And Deb I'm going to remove that whereas the field site

03:18.670 --> 03:23.320
so let's remove the field cells because we don't really need it anymore.

03:24.600 --> 03:33.410
And let's say we don't need the legend Either we can just keep the must labels remove the label for

03:33.410 --> 03:35.650
this one as well.

03:35.870 --> 03:38.360
A bit of quick clean up here.

03:42.730 --> 03:46.680
Let's say that we don't really need this day of wrapping either.

03:46.810 --> 03:50.110
Just to keep things a little bit cleaner we don't need this

03:53.990 --> 03:55.250
perfect look of that.

03:55.250 --> 03:57.290
Things are already looking nice and clean.

04:01.670 --> 04:04.780
And I'm just going to remove this terribly.

04:04.780 --> 04:13.490
All right a little bit cleaner let's save see how that looks so far if I go to View profile a little

04:13.490 --> 04:18.800
bit better look at that we have the icon the name images submitted member and that looks still a little

04:18.800 --> 04:20.560
bit ugly so let's fix that up.

04:21.880 --> 04:31.840
Want to first fix the indentation is she going to remove this measure as well since we don't really

04:31.840 --> 04:32.710
need it.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.000
Let's fix it in notation over here.

04:39.030 --> 04:40.390
That's a lot better.

04:40.400 --> 04:47.070
All right let's start off with the label we want to have a few different classes for the label now we'll

04:47.070 --> 04:53.710
have margin top to font weight of six that should be good enough.

04:55.180 --> 04:59.750
And this will be for the user name field.

04:59.760 --> 05:05.010
So let's just say user name and we'll just use something like that.

05:05.910 --> 05:16.680
For the input OAB type text the name will be for the user name and then for the class name we can just

05:16.680 --> 05:21.550
keep some of this you don't need to worry about input resets.

05:21.660 --> 05:24.870
We don't really want a transparent background.

05:26.300 --> 05:32.690
And you know just to keep things simple I just want to say with those 100 that's good enough for us

05:33.170 --> 05:35.120
and perhaps we can have a placeholder

05:37.720 --> 05:41.040
that is the name that we want for now.

05:41.040 --> 05:41.800
Just keep it at

05:44.880 --> 05:47.280
John and we will have an onchange event.

05:47.340 --> 05:50.040
So I can just remove that.

05:50.180 --> 05:54.640
And you know what just so I don't keep doing this.

05:54.640 --> 06:03.670
I'm going to use whatever we have now which I kind of like if we check back here go to View Profile.

06:03.990 --> 06:05.390
Yeah that looks a lot better.

06:05.400 --> 06:12.480
I'm going to just copy and paste these fields over here and change them to a few of the different types

06:12.480 --> 06:14.140
list you want for page

06:17.550 --> 06:21.520
leaseholder will just be 56 for now.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.040
It's going to be for user age.

06:25.380 --> 06:26.890
Heidi over age as well.

06:28.430 --> 06:34.310
And this one let's just say they also have a pact that they can have had it's going to be a pet dragon

06:36.050 --> 06:37.480
username.

06:37.610 --> 06:43.020
Pat idea of Pat let's save let's have a look.

06:45.800 --> 06:46.360
All right.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.470
Not bad.

06:47.500 --> 06:48.930
It's looking pretty good.

06:51.260 --> 07:00.680
And then maybe at the bottom we can add some buttons that say we'll have a save and a cancel so that

07:00.680 --> 07:09.780
we can update our profile we'll give it a class name margin top of for and you know what I'm going to

07:09.780 --> 07:12.630
give it some special styles as well.

07:12.630 --> 07:13.680
We'll do display

07:16.780 --> 07:22.970
flaks just to keep everything nice and centered justify

07:25.390 --> 07:31.240
of space evenly matched should be good.

07:31.270 --> 07:33.530
Make sure we close that div tag

07:36.760 --> 07:46.600
and within here we can just have a button that again has a class name and just using some tag counts

07:46.600 --> 07:47.350
here.

07:50.140 --> 07:56.570
We're going to do a few things here I'm just gonna copy and paste this to the other button as well.

07:56.570 --> 08:08.260
So one's going to be for Save one is gonna be for cancell.

08:08.490 --> 08:12.390
So this button is going to be our save one

08:20.200 --> 08:21.550
and we'll have another button

08:24.610 --> 08:26.600
that will be Canso.

08:26.710 --> 08:29.310
Let's say that give that a go.

08:29.320 --> 08:30.560
We'll see how it looks.

08:32.130 --> 08:32.900
Hey better.

08:32.900 --> 08:38.640
I think some of our sailing can be improved year.

08:39.030 --> 08:46.540
We want to make sure that this is going to be red instead of blue because it is cancell and not space

08:46.560 --> 08:51.570
even the space even Lee has better.

08:51.590 --> 08:58.260
I think that's why I wasn't keeping the buns to get all look at that now looks WAY nicer.

08:58.260 --> 08:59.270
All right look at that.

08:59.310 --> 09:01.450
We have ourselves a profile.

09:01.590 --> 09:02.550
And you know what.

09:02.550 --> 09:04.080
Everything looks good.

09:05.860 --> 09:10.460
Except the buns don't do anything and we probably need an X button over here as well.

09:10.570 --> 09:12.070
So let's do that.

09:12.190 --> 09:19.060
We'll give the class castle one a toggle moto or on click that is

09:22.310 --> 09:28.190
toggle motile and you can see here with re-act you're doing a lot of repetition but once you get the

09:28.190 --> 09:35.320
hang of it everything flows nicely and it makes sense you just keep adding events adding components

09:35.750 --> 09:39.460
and it's a nice way to build something quite fast actually.

09:39.740 --> 09:44.230
So we have the toggle motile and lets out an X of the top here.

09:46.480 --> 09:49.750
Or maybe at the bottom over here should the cancel.

09:50.020 --> 09:51.860
We can just add.

09:52.270 --> 10:04.380
So right at the top over here we can just give it a div of class name will create a new class C assess

10:04.380 --> 10:05.870
class year to make it look better.

10:05.870 --> 10:17.110
And again we're going to give it or not a click of toggle modal and will be a giant x that will have.

10:17.740 --> 10:25.830
So let's give that a go or to save go back here view profile and look at that.

10:26.270 --> 10:30.790
Some bad.

10:30.810 --> 10:31.160
All right.

10:31.160 --> 10:35.090
There's actually a nicer X that I can get.

10:35.220 --> 10:43.230
And this is just a nicer way of creating that X-1 that you see everywhere with modals and you just do

10:44.010 --> 10:52.110
and symbol and then times semi-coma and you see that it changes.

10:52.190 --> 11:00.380
So I'm going to say that and also at some modal close classes or so the modal close will out the modal

11:00.380 --> 11:00.910
close

11:04.240 --> 11:12.650
will give it the font size of the SCO three R.E.M..

11:12.660 --> 11:24.290
So a pretty big font style new style of bold and maybe give it a cursor of pointer as well.

11:24.520 --> 11:26.350
And we also want to have a hover class.

11:26.350 --> 11:32.150
So let's just do modal close.

11:32.290 --> 11:44.430
However And we'll just do a color of gray when we hover over it and a cursor that is pointer let's say

11:44.440 --> 11:50.360
if give it a go view profile look at that.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.570
That's not too bad.

11:52.780 --> 11:59.390
If we click Cancel the modal closes if we click View profile and say it doesn't do anything good because

11:59.390 --> 12:00.760
it we're going to be working on that.

12:00.870 --> 12:03.880
If I click Close it also closes.

12:03.880 --> 12:10.500
And then finally to finish up what we've just done make sure that the sign out feature works as well.

12:10.540 --> 12:19.750
I'm going to say is signed in to false is our route to sign in and test one last feature.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.460
To make sure that it's all working.

12:22.460 --> 12:28.400
And then after this we get to some fun logic sign out.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.360
Perfect.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.430
I'll see in the next video.
