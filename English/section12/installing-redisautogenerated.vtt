00:01.090 --> 00:09.890
Come back let's install rattus onto our laptop or computers in order to actually use it and test some

00:09.890 --> 00:10.940
commands.

00:10.940 --> 00:16.880
Now keep in mind when it comes to databases most of the time you won't actually be running from your

00:16.880 --> 00:17.680
computer.

00:18.580 --> 00:26.120
In most cases it's going to be on a server or another machine that is just dedicated to that database.

00:26.260 --> 00:31.540
And we're going to be doing the same for Radice but because we want to test it out make sure that we

00:31.540 --> 00:34.940
know the commands and we can run it locally as well.

00:34.960 --> 00:39.920
It's good to practice the skills now in order to download it.

00:39.920 --> 00:41.380
It's very very simple.

00:41.420 --> 00:43.510
We simply go to their download tab

00:48.430 --> 00:53.470
and we see here that they have daquiri images as well which we might use later on.

00:53.470 --> 00:54.280
Hint hint.

00:54.430 --> 01:03.450
But for now we're going to get the stable version 4.0 and you can click download here or if he keeps

01:03.450 --> 01:08.140
scrolling down you see that you have some commands that you can use to get it.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.300
So you have two options.

01:09.310 --> 01:15.640
You can either just click on the download link that is appear which will download a file as you can

01:15.640 --> 01:16.490
see over here.

01:17.970 --> 01:23.240
And with that fall you can actually just open it and then run these commands.

01:24.200 --> 01:29.100
But for now just because we have these available to us I'm going to run the commands.

01:29.150 --> 01:33.820
So the first one is to get this thing that will get us Radice installed.

01:35.100 --> 01:38.820
So let's open up a terminal here and run the command.

01:38.820 --> 01:42.050
You see that it's installing and wants their son.

01:42.180 --> 01:53.770
We have to open it up with the tar command and then finally we get CD now into the red S 4.0 0.9.

01:53.790 --> 01:59.240
You might have different version as long as it's above 4.0 you should be fine.

01:59.350 --> 02:02.560
And this folder was created for us so let's just go in there.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.950
I'm want to clear.

02:04.660 --> 02:11.180
And then we see that the final command that we need is make which executes something called the Makefile.

02:11.670 --> 02:15.850
So let's do that.

02:16.050 --> 02:21.900
And this is going to be running to set everything up for us if we go back to the documentation.

02:21.900 --> 02:30.170
We see that the only thing we can do now is to run the source Retta server that is to run the red a

02:30.210 --> 02:36.960
server just like we did with postscripts to make sure that the Postgres server is running and sprawling

02:36.960 --> 02:43.080
and we are running on some port and then we can run the red S C like command to actually have access

02:43.530 --> 02:47.030
to this database and run some rattus commands.

02:47.040 --> 02:50.970
So let's open up let's minimize this and go back and.

02:51.000 --> 02:51.560
All right.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.890
We see that everything has been loaded.

02:53.910 --> 03:01.580
It gives us a suggestion to run make test to make sure that everything has been installed correctly.

03:03.050 --> 03:05.630
And it all run through some tests here.

03:05.690 --> 03:10.760
I'm not going to go through that just because I trust that everything was said but it's always good

03:10.760 --> 03:12.880
to run make test.

03:12.930 --> 03:21.820
All right so here you see that we've downloaded the tar file we've opened it into the Radice folder

03:21.910 --> 03:25.990
and now I'm inside of this folder of a nice background today.

03:27.650 --> 03:31.080
For any of those wondering where I'm getting these backgrounds from.

03:31.080 --> 03:37.610
Why have this desktop app called Art Pipp that has a different painting every day which is nice.

03:37.610 --> 03:44.060
Anyway back to what we're doing I can go over here and type source remember just like the documentation

03:44.240 --> 03:44.980
suggested.

03:45.370 --> 03:50.390
Read s server to start the server for Precentor.

03:50.810 --> 03:57.230
You'll see that it asks on my computer if they have if I can give access so that it accepts incoming

03:57.230 --> 03:59.750
network connections I'll allow it.

03:59.960 --> 04:06.460
And you see that we're now ready to accept connections and it gives you a nice little graphic here too

04:06.460 --> 04:08.980
that you can see.

04:09.010 --> 04:09.900
All right.

04:10.210 --> 04:11.740
I'm going to move this on this side.

04:11.800 --> 04:18.040
So the servers running now and I'm going to open up another window and with this one we're going to

04:18.040 --> 04:19.090
run the CLID.

04:19.240 --> 04:28.940
I'm going to say source for I have to go into the reddest folder and then run source rattus see a lot.

04:29.590 --> 04:30.640
And there we go.

04:30.700 --> 04:35.610
We're connected to this server and we can start running some Radice commands.

04:35.980 --> 04:40.840
And the next video we're going to learn some of these commands and how we can actually enter data into

04:40.840 --> 04:42.020
our rattus server.

04:42.490 --> 04:43.210
I'll see one.
