00:00.650 --> 00:03.070
Our robo friends are looking really really nice.

00:03.080 --> 00:05.690
I really like this up there is one issue though.

00:05.870 --> 00:14.540
If I minimize this OK it's responsive it looks good but if I scroll down well I lose my search bar at

00:14.540 --> 00:14.940
the top.

00:14.940 --> 00:20.940
Would it be nice if this was at the top and I have a scroll that I can do and still search through my

00:20.940 --> 00:21.320
friends

00:24.460 --> 00:30.070
well you might be thinking well there's probably a CSSA style that I can add here but I want to illustrate

00:30.070 --> 00:39.160
to you the fact that react and we react to so good is because you can create components that are were

00:39.160 --> 00:42.500
usable not just car components but functionality.

00:42.550 --> 00:48.070
Would it be cool if there was maybe something where we can add a round card list.

00:48.070 --> 00:58.910
Maybe I can create a scroll component and this scroll component just wraps the cardless.

00:59.140 --> 01:02.100
And now cardless will be completely scrollable.

01:02.140 --> 01:07.630
But now I can use scroll this component anywhere in my app any time I need scrolling.

01:07.930 --> 01:10.690
I can just wrap it around.

01:10.760 --> 01:11.810
Can we do this.

01:11.870 --> 01:12.740
Let's give it a try.

01:14.660 --> 01:19.080
I'm going to import a component that we don't have yet.

01:19.100 --> 01:30.340
That's called scroll from a file that will create in just a second as create a new file.

01:30.560 --> 01:31.890
We'll call that scroll.

01:32.000 --> 01:32.580
J.S.

01:35.290 --> 01:42.800
and here will again go through the motion of re-act from re-act.

01:42.850 --> 01:44.290
Make this a little bit bigger.

01:46.100 --> 01:54.440
And again I want to change this to baseball and we'll say Konst scroll.

01:54.550 --> 02:01.770
He calls it's going to return from what should have returned.

02:01.800 --> 02:11.740
Before we talk about that just so we don't forget we have to export default skirl.

02:11.760 --> 02:19.000
Now here's a problem we want to return something but it doesn't make sense does it.

02:19.000 --> 02:27.760
If I go to AB dodgy Yes scrawl it's not a self closing component it wraps components.

02:27.800 --> 02:33.690
So how can we tell scroll to hey just render whatever's inside of you.

02:36.270 --> 02:44.240
Up to this point we've learned about props and we've learned about state.

02:44.330 --> 02:53.010
There's one or the thing and react that I want to teach you and that is children and children is this

02:54.270 --> 03:00.270
scrawl can use children as a way to render its children.

03:00.690 --> 03:01.770
What do I mean by that.

03:02.990 --> 03:09.650
Well in here every profs object has children.

03:09.750 --> 03:16.360
So if I go prop's dot children let's see what happens.

03:16.580 --> 03:28.380
I save and go back everything's render but if I remove this and I just do and H-1

03:36.950 --> 03:45.050
I just get this you see props start children is exactly that.

03:45.050 --> 03:49.440
If I Konsole thought log props

03:53.470 --> 03:54.760
Let's open up the con..

03:54.850 --> 03:57.730
I see that I get an object.

03:57.730 --> 04:07.510
And even though I am pass any props to scroll automatically every single component named Bre-X has this

04:07.510 --> 04:08.260
property.

04:09.490 --> 04:17.990
Children and this children a kind of looks confusing here but has card list type cardless

04:22.380 --> 04:32.720
So using this Propst our children we can create components that wrap other components up to this point

04:32.730 --> 04:39.450
we were only able to wrap these lower case components which are kind of like the team tags.

04:39.780 --> 04:44.910
But every time we had a custom component with a capital letter that we built well we can really wrap

04:44.910 --> 04:45.920
it.

04:45.970 --> 04:50.630
Now we can using this thought children.

04:50.730 --> 04:52.620
But here's the cool part.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.830
Using props to our children.

04:55.110 --> 05:07.130
Well I can create a scrollable component Let me show you how simply do diff clothes that Dave and then

05:07.140 --> 05:16.080
here again curly brackets prop's dot chose you and all we need now is to add styles to this div I could

05:16.080 --> 05:22.590
create a scroll dot CSSA file and add a style so it's scrollable but I want to show you another way

05:22.590 --> 05:33.090
which is using stuff just like an HMO using this style attribute an GSX I can add styles but using double

05:33.090 --> 05:34.960
curly brackets that is.

05:35.130 --> 05:37.780
This is a javascript expression.

05:38.040 --> 05:43.670
And within this I'm returning an object and this object can have CSSA else.

05:45.100 --> 05:47.730
Such as a property overflow.

05:47.740 --> 05:49.660
Why.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.840
Which is a CSSA property.

05:51.980 --> 06:02.990
And this we can say scroll again a CSSA way to make the elements scrollable will say border is one pixel

06:03.290 --> 06:05.660
solid block.

06:06.080 --> 06:15.450
And finally we'll give it a height of 500 pixels going to make this smaller so you can see I'm going

06:15.450 --> 06:21.560
to save compiling is fine if I go back it looks like we have a box here.

06:21.640 --> 06:26.480
Let's make it a little bit bigger Just so you can see say five pixels even though it's ugly.

06:26.560 --> 06:29.350
And I forgot a t in here.

06:29.650 --> 06:30.130
Right.

06:30.130 --> 06:30.360
All right.

06:30.370 --> 06:35.660
Let's see that we have a scrollable component.

06:36.690 --> 06:44.080
Let's make this a little bit bigger just so we can see a better look at that.

06:44.110 --> 06:53.580
If I make the smaller I now have a scrollable component side of this.

06:53.710 --> 06:55.250
Very cool.

06:55.270 --> 06:57.540
Now this is a simple.

06:57.790 --> 07:00.240
It allows you to search.

07:00.520 --> 07:07.460
It allows you to scroll but it does show the power of react doesn't it.

07:08.210 --> 07:18.020
We've created these simple functions and the only thing that we tell it to do is well we tell it what

07:18.020 --> 07:28.890
state it has the entire app is described through these two things the robots and search field and re-act

07:29.010 --> 07:30.600
takes care of the breast.

07:30.870 --> 07:38.150
As soon as search field or robot changes react trickles down.

07:38.150 --> 07:46.850
All this information as props to all these components and magically creates our view for us.

07:46.850 --> 07:49.660
That's why react is so powerful it's a view layer.

07:49.820 --> 07:55.570
It takes care of manipulating the DOM and all we tell it is hey what's the state.

07:55.730 --> 07:59.570
What are the functions that you wanted to work with the state and the rest.

07:59.570 --> 08:06.350
Well it optimizes to make sure that everything is super fast and you can see how amazingly fast everything

08:06.350 --> 08:06.810
is here.

08:06.830 --> 08:11.730
It's a super snappy app and these components are now reusable.

08:12.170 --> 08:19.460
I can bring a search box now into a another part of the web site I can add scrolling to another part

08:19.460 --> 08:20.300
of the Web site.

08:21.190 --> 08:27.300
This is what made react so powerful and this is why so many Web sites are powered by re-act.

08:27.420 --> 08:35.770
Once you learn the syntax and you get used to everything that's when re-act truly becomes powerful.

08:35.910 --> 08:41.580
And although we took a bit of time to create this app once you get used to it an hour like this you

08:41.580 --> 08:45.510
can create it in less than an hour probably 30 minutes.

08:46.990 --> 08:47.710
All right.

08:47.710 --> 08:49.910
I think we've done a great job here.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.290
Can't wait to see you in the next video.
