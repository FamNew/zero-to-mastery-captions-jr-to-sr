OK are Rubell friends frenzy is starting to look good it does some searching which is great.

00:07.280 --> 00:08.790
It's very interactive.

00:08.960 --> 00:12.100
But let's add some style so just sort of looks like this.

00:12.380 --> 00:15.770
And I mean Stiles is something that we've already covered.

00:15.770 --> 00:18.520
I want to get you up and running quickly.

00:18.570 --> 00:24.800
Let's start off with first the background as you can see we can just generate a gradient and have that

00:24.800 --> 00:25.930
background.

00:26.180 --> 00:30.420
I've already found a really good background greedy and that we can use.

00:30.770 --> 00:35.950
You can use the background generator that we've actually already created in previous videos for now

00:36.290 --> 00:44.000
as you know if we want to change the CSSA of our entire app Well we have index start CSSA which is perfect

00:44.000 --> 00:44.830
for this.

00:44.990 --> 00:53.440
And then we can just put in the gradient that we want going to save this and look at that.

00:53.560 --> 01:00.790
It tells us that there is an update and gradient has outdated directions syntax new syntax is like two

01:00.790 --> 01:03.960
left instead of right.

01:04.010 --> 01:05.680
Isn't that convenient.

01:05.720 --> 01:06.420
Let's do that.

01:07.220 --> 01:07.980
Two left.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.750
Let's see if that still works.

01:11.540 --> 01:13.800
OK everything's looking nice.

01:13.810 --> 01:14.510
Perfect.

01:14.710 --> 01:16.640
Let's fix our font.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.330
Now if you see over here we have this cool font.

01:19.330 --> 01:20.840
How did I get that.

01:20.860 --> 01:28.940
Actually I just googled for the Sega Logo font and I found this web site that has free fonts you can

01:28.940 --> 01:29.400
use.

01:30.690 --> 01:35.640
And we can actually just click on generate font face wet font and there's something that you don't really

01:35.640 --> 01:39.660
need to know is just a matter of googling finding the font that you want.

01:39.870 --> 01:48.860
But if you download this file you'll see that it actually has c w o f which is actually a font file

01:49.430 --> 01:59.190
and styles Azzi SS So it actually tells you why you can include let's copy that added to our head or

01:59.190 --> 02:05.620
one which if you look over here lives in app dot J Yes.

02:06.180 --> 02:11.640
Using app datcha SS which I think we've deleted that already so let's bring it back by adding a new

02:11.640 --> 02:14.520
file app dot CSSA.

02:14.940 --> 02:22.020
So we'll just copy and paste what we did and font face just tells us our font and in order to use that

02:22.080 --> 02:37.220
we'll just say H-1 has font family of Sega Logo font.

02:37.270 --> 02:42.610
Now this don't actually do anything because well we need the font file so they can find Sega Logo font

02:45.360 --> 02:49.960
and that's simply a matter of us dragging in our font file.

02:50.000 --> 02:58.300
Let's minimize this into our robo friends and let's see now.

02:58.310 --> 03:00.160
It should be right over here.

03:01.040 --> 03:05.380
And we can simply access it by looking at the.

03:05.420 --> 03:07.430
You are Al.

03:07.560 --> 03:13.830
If our app dot CSSA file has access to this font we can just move it

03:19.070 --> 03:26.550
into our source folder.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.060
All right.

03:27.060 --> 03:32.940
And one thing you might notice is that while nothing will change because in order for the CSSA file

03:32.940 --> 03:39.990
to work we have to import it to always remember import apt.

03:40.210 --> 03:41.550
C Ss.

03:41.790 --> 03:43.090
Save it.

03:43.330 --> 03:44.980
Compiling.

03:45.170 --> 03:45.880
All right.

03:45.950 --> 03:51.500
I don't know if we can see it but it's there so we want to make it bigger and obviously the color block

03:51.500 --> 03:53.270
doesn't work well with this background.

03:55.080 --> 03:58.620
Again this part is an CSSA song going to go through this quickly.

03:58.620 --> 04:03.570
I have a few styles here font weight and a color that is nice.

04:03.570 --> 04:11.030
Make sure that we have it imported and using tacky Kyon's we can just make this bigger.

04:11.090 --> 04:16.620
We can just say class name he calls.

04:16.760 --> 04:17.330
He can do.

04:17.330 --> 04:19.390
EF 1 EF 2 lose to have 2

04:22.710 --> 04:27.570
Swan All right now looks pretty good.

04:29.020 --> 04:33.350
Our app is looking nice and clean.

04:33.350 --> 04:39.490
There are still a few changes that we want to make but overall everything looks good.

04:39.530 --> 04:42.260
We played around a bit with the CSSA.

04:42.440 --> 04:49.880
We've added a new font file and we changed a background of index thought JS file with the index dot

04:50.060 --> 04:53.070
CSSA.

04:53.140 --> 04:57.400
All right we're going to get back to learning more react in the next video.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.400
I'll see on that one.

04:58.410 --> 04:58.820
Bye bye.
